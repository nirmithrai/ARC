**user**: Can you list all the book notes in my vault?

**ai**: 
<think>Hmm, the user is asking for a list of all book notes in their Obsidian vault. Looking at the recent conversation, I see there was a previous attempt to query the vault that returned empty results because the source catalog was empty. 

The user's current query is straightforward but depends entirely on the vault's content. I need to check if there are any book notes available in the provided context. Since I don't see any book-related notes in the current context, I should inform the user that no book notes were found and ask if they want me to search more broadly.

I should also mention the possibility of tagging conventions in case the user organizes notes differently. Keeping the response helpful and actionable while being honest about the lack of results is key here.</think>Based on the current context, I don't see any book notes listed in your vault. The recent conversation shows that the vault query returned an empty source catalog, meaning no accessible data was found to identify book notes.

To help you better:
- Could you confirm if your book notes use a specific naming convention (like "Book: Title") or a particular tag (like `#book`)?
- Would you like me to search more broadly for any notes in your vault?

If you have a specific organization method for book notes, sharing that detail will allow me to provide a more accurate list.
