tried downloading some files from the GDC audio bundle and creating a scene. i was very limited in what i could do, but it turned out quite well. i could get my point/story across. i just wanted to do it once to see if it was as easy as i thought it would be. and it was that easy. the hard part was sourcing the sounds. the gdc packs have a lot of sounds. variety and variety of sounds. i just have to trust that it has the sound i need. i guess sound would be one of the later things i would need in a level. but its good to know i have a decent source. 

so sfx is taken care of. i can do more, like find ambience loops and make a collections

but next thing i want to get started on is music production. that's probably gonna take the most amount of time. so i should start learning a tool that let me do that. Voice Over i'll do last because that's one i'll have to hire voice actors for or use AI to do.
