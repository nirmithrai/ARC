want to get walk working


im trying to get my soul, brain, body architecture to work. i think i have a solution. . brain to body connection is one way anyway. 
brain (walk ability) has walk(dir) and walk_to(target) and body has move(dir, vel), play_anim(ANIM), play_sfx(SFX), etc. so brain can just construct what should happen through those funcions. and i can add run ability and still make the body move.
the problem i was facing is between soul and brain. the abilities contained in the brain are modular and can be replaced, so the soul controllers can never know if an ability/function even exists. 
i think i found a solution. i can have the walk ability subscribe to soul signals. so soul can emit its intentions and different brain abilites can subscribe to them and execture various functions based on the soul's intentions. 

i think i basically need to have a list of action tags and intent tags in memory. soul can refer to the action tags to determine intent and abilities can subscribe to intent signals and do what they will with it.
