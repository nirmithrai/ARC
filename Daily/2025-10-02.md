ok, so i've been exploring the [[TakinGodotTemplate]]

its very complicated. lot of moving parts and a lot of interconnected systems. its best left alone. at least for now. its a great way thing to use when i want to finally publish a game, but it is not something i want when im developing the game. 

i've noted down how to change the game (from what i understand at least)
i should give it a try.
