ok, so i've been exploring the [[TakinGodotTemplate]]

its very complicated. lot of moving parts and a lot of interconnected systems. its best left alone. at least for now. its a great way thing to use when i want to finally publish a game, but it is not something i want when im developing the game. 

i've noted down how to change the game (from what i understand at least)
i should give it a try.

ok, after giving a good try, it might be too complicated for a template. yes, it has a lot of features, but the problem is that is has a lot of features.its too annoying to build an entire game in. its too annoying to import a game into. and even then it has a bunch of systems and addons that might collide with the systems the game is using. the scene manager was the worst. just makes it so much more annoying to work in. 

so let me go back and take a look at the other templates.
