i do want to create that prototype kit. now that im using [[Blockbench]], im more excited.

this is important for fixing the texture issue
"embedded image handling" set to "umbedded as uncompressed"

ok, next thing i figured out is how to have have a library thing. 

so i right click on the .glb/gltf file and say new inherited scene. 
with this new scene i can do whatever i want with it and then save as a typical godot scene. if i make any new edits, i can overwrite that export and it should update the scene as well. great.
