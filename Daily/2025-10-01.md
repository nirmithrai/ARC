i need space to think and i want to think through writing. dont worry aboput spelling errors or gramatical mistakes. you're not going to read this agian. i just want to get it out of my head.

anyway. 

the main topic of discussion is how i want to proceed with game dev. let's assume i've solved the problem fo fantasizing and i want to actually have an action plan. i need to get into the mind of a manager. how does a game studio's CEO proceed with this. 

lets list out what i want the end goal to be. 
pie in the sky. the journalist game with every mechanic that ever existed. 
where i am. barely a demo finished. 
this is not a judgement, its just an assessment.

now lets figure out how to go from a to z. 

ok, so i have the first step ready. which is to create a test room. we'll put a pin in how to get that done, but what after that?

i want to make smaller games each with one mechanic. i'm sure i can be creative and figure that out. 

i can use the test room as a base. movement, camera, ui sound, controls. i could also use a base template as well. let's forgot about learning (cz we hate school anyway) and focus on actual tangible projects. 

actually, test room is a good base for testing stuff, but i can still use a "game template" for a kickstart on all the games i build. remember [[The Pottery Experiment]]. we want to get any many reps in as possible.
