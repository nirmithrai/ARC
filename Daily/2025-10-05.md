its been a couple of days, but whatever. lets do one thing at a time

first. basic 3d movement. the addon i was looking at already had walk run and jump. now i want to add crouch and interact to it. 

- [x] fork that library first. 
- [x] clone it into my local
- [ ] add crouch
- [ ] add interact
- [ ] push
