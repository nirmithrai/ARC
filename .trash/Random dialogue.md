Does it hurt when you die?
The spell absorbs most of the pain which helps me stay conscious during the fight. But death does hurt.

What does death feel like?
*chuckles* I asked my master the same question when I learned the spell. Ill tell you what he told me. "Dont be in a hurry to find out"



What was your master like?
He was a hard master. Demanded Absolute perfection in everything. I found that unnecessarily hard at that time. But its just the nature of magic.
"There are infinite ways for a spell to go wrong.", he used to say, "But there is only one way for it to go right." 
What Ive learned over the years is that there are actually more than one ways for a spell to go right, but its closer to one than to Infinity. So i suggest you take my master's approach and stick to perfection.



Why did you pick me as your apprentice?
*sigh* i ask myself that every day...
... Oh
Haha, im just joking old boy. The reason i picked you is a little embarrassing to admit, to be frank with you.
Embarrassing?
You see, i wanted to prove my old master wrong. He always believed that the power of magic can only be harnessed by those who were born with the talent to do so. He had a rigorous examination of magic skills before he would take on an apprentice. I excelled at this examination and he justifiably called me the most talented of the lot and took me in.
But i dont believe in talent. I believe that interest and passion in your craft is what matters. Which is why i didnt pick the most "talented" kid to be my apprentice. I picked the kid that wanted to be a wizard the most. Thats why i picked you despite your lack of skills. A kid with no talent would make just as powerful a wizard as any with natural affinities. 



Pop quiz. What do you do when i call for battle?
Step 1 i teleport out
Why
Because im more useful alive than dead
Good
Step 2 i cast the dome spell so that the enemy cannot escape
And then?
Step 3 i cast the resurrection spell in case you die.
Excellent
