quick notes

You had Salt-N-Pepa’s “Push It” down for 1987. Its first release was 1986 (B-side, then reissued and blew up in ’87). Since you asked for month precision, I kept it to 1986/march and left it off here to avoid cluttering duplicates; shout if you want it explicitly listed and I’ll slot it at 1986/march. 


If this looks good, say “next” and I’ll do 1990–1999 (with the same rules).
