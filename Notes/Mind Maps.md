Mind maps are diagrams sort of like trees which connect the various parts of a book or a topic together in a visual way, making it easier to remember/learn.

Mind maps always seemed not that useful to me since most of the time they would just be a glorified Table of Contents, just outlining the topic. They were not big enough to hold any details, so i didnt find a point in using them.

[[Cluster approach to reading]] finally made me see the use of mind maps. It makes more sense to make maps around the anchors you find in a book rather than the topic headings of the book itself. That makes it complimentary to a book, mapping the key points of the topic across the book.
Sure there is chance that the mind map might end up being similar to the table of contents anyway, it all depends on the structure of the book. But it might help pull out emergent themes from a book that may not have been explicitly explained as a separate section.
