The Upanishads
Eknath Easwaran

Upanishads are the oldest, so varied that we feel some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the photos, postcards, and letters from this world that they could find, without any regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form a kind of ecstatic slide show – snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation.

*****

The Dhammapada, too, is a collection – traditionally, sayings of the Buddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness.

*****

Most important, he urges us that it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves. Everything else is secondary.

*****

Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and guidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various approaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers recommendations, tells us what to pack and what to leave behind.

*****

The world of the senses is just a base camp: we are meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world of physical reality.

*****

“Take the example of a man who has everything,” I read with a start of recognition: “young, healthy, strong, good, and cultured, with all the wealth that earth can offer; let us take this as one measure of joy.” The comparison was right from my life. “One hundred times that joy is the joy of the gandharvas; but no less joy have those who are illumined.”

*****

“There is no joy in the finite; there is joy only in the Infinite.”

*****

With each reading I feel I am setting out on a sea so deep and vast that one can never reach its end.

*****

And although the devas must once have been a pantheon of separate deities, it seems clear even in the earliest hymns that one Supreme Being is being worshipped in different aspects. “Truth is one,” one hymn proclaims, “though the wise call it by many names.”

*****

brahmins, whose function in society was to preserve rites already too ancient to be understood.

*****

the Vedas are revealed knowledge, given to humanity, according to the orthodox view, at the very dawn of time.

*****

The first and largest part of each collection, called karma kanda, preserves the hymns and philosophical interpretations of rituals used in Hindu worship to this day.

*****

The second part of each Veda, called jnana kanda, concerns not ritual but wisdom: what life is about; what death means; what the human being is, and the nature of the Godhead that sustains us;

*****

What is an Upanishad? Etymologically the word suggests “sitting down near”: that is, at the feet of an illumined teacher in an intimate session of spiritual instruction,

*****

Their purpose is not so much instruction as inspiration: they are meant to be expounded by an illumined teacher from the basis of personal experience.

*****

They tell us that there is a Reality underlying life which rituals cannot reach, next to which the things we see and touch in everyday life are shadows.

*****

They teach that this Reality is the essence of every created thing, and the same Reality is our real Self, so that each of us is one with the power that created and sustains the universe. And, finally, they testify that this oneness can be realized directly, without the mediation of priests or rituals or any of the structures of organized religion, not after death but in this life, and that this is the purpose for which each of us has been born and the goal toward which evolution moves.

*****

“All science,” Aldous Huxley wrote, “. . . is the reduction of multiplicities to unities.”

*****

The sages of the Upanishads show a unique preoccupation with states of consciousness.

*****

They became absorbed in the discovery that as concentration deepens, the mind actually passes through the states of consciousness being inquired about. And in concentrating on consciousness itself – “Who is the knower?” – they found they could separate strata of the mind and observe its workings as objectively as a botanist observes a flower.

*****

Meditation here is not reflection or any other kind of discursive thinking. It is pure concentration: training the mind to dwell on an interior focus without wandering, until it becomes absorbed in the object of its contemplation.

*****

“By knowing one piece of gold,” the Upanishads observed, “all things made out of gold are known: they differ only in name and form, while the stuff of which all are made is gold.” And they asked, “What is that one by knowing which we can know the nature of everything else?” They found the answer in consciousness. Its study was called brahmavidya, which means both “the supreme science” and “the science of the Supreme.”

*****

Meditation is closely related to this kind of absorption, but the focus is not something external that one looks at or listens to, such as a microscope slide or lecture. It is consciousness itself, which means that all the senses close down.

*****

But brahmavidya is not concerned with the insights that come from concentrating on a particular part of life; it is concerned with how concentration yields insight at all.

*****

If the observer observes through the medium of consciousness, and the world too is observed in consciousness, should not the same laws apply to both?

*****

states of mind the sages explored. They called them waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep,

*****

represent layers of awareness, concurrent strata lying at different depths in the conscious and unconscious mind.

*****

This still world is always present in the depths of the mind. It is the deepest, most universal layer of the unconscious. Wake up in this state, the Upanishads say, and you will be who you truly are, free from the conditioning of body and mind in a world unbounded by the limitations of time, space, and causality.

*****

Dream and waking are made of the same stuff, and as far as the nervous system is concerned, both kinds of experience are real.

*****

“Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?”

*****

The sages found a clue: in dreamless sleep, the observing self detaches itself not only from the body but from the mind.

*****

The message of the Katha, which echoes throughout the Upanishads, is to dare like a teenager: to reach for the highest you can conceive with everything you have, and never count the cost.

*****

You are what your deep, driving desire is.

 As your desire is, so is your will.

 As your will is, so is your deed.

 As your deed is, so is your destiny.
[ Brihadaranyaka IV.4.5 ]

*****

Tapas, the sages say, becomes tejas: the radiant splendor of personality that shows itself in love, compassion, creative action, and a melting tenderness which draws all hearts.

*****

In Sanskrit this ardent, one-pointed, self-transcending passion is called tapas, and the Vedas revere it as an unsurpassable creative force.

*****

Brahmacharya, self-control in thought and action, was a prerequisite in these forest academies.

*****

These are, roughly, components of what we call “mind”: the senses, emotions, intellect, will.

*****

Concentration is so profound that the mind-process has almost come to a standstill. Space is gone, and time so attenuated that it scarcely seems real. This is a taste of shanti, “the peace that passeth understanding,” invoked at the end of every Upanishad as a reminder of this sublime state.

*****

In meditation, as the mind settles down to dwell on a single focus, attention begins to flow in a smooth, unbroken stream, like oil poured from one container to another. As this happens, attention naturally retreats from other channels.

*****

Eventually there comes a time when you get up from meditation and know that your body is not you.

*****

Turiya, the Upanishads say, is waking up in dreamless sleep: in the very depths of the unconscious, where one is aware of neither body nor mind.

*****

Most important, you lose your fear of death. You know with certitude that death is not the end, and that you will not die when the body dies.

*****

The mind is not conscious; it is only an instrument of consciousness – or, in different metaphors, a process, a complex field of forces. Yet when awareness is withdrawn from the mind, you remain aware. When this happens you realize you are not the mind, any more than you are the physical body.

*****

This tremendous equation – “the Self is Brahman” – is the central discovery of the Upanishads.

*****

“There is no joy in the finite; there is joy only in the infinite.” That is the message of the Upanishads.

*****

“What was there before the Big Bang?” Physicists reply, with Gertrude Stein, “There’s no ‘there’ there. There’s no ‘then’ then.” Space and time, matter and energy, sprung into existence at the moment of creation; “before” that moment the concepts do not apply.

*****

“Apta-kamam atma-kamam akamam rupam: That is his real form, where he is free from all desires because all his desires are fulfilled; for the Self is all our desire.”

*****

They tell us, first, that whatever we are, whatever we may have done, there is in each of us an inalienable Self that is divine:

*****

All experience is real. Confusion arises only when a dream experience is treated as reality after one awakes – or when life is viewed as nothing but sensation, without wholeness, meaning, or goal.

*****

They remind us that love is the first and last commandment of this realization, for the same Self dwells in all:

*****

When all desires that surge in the heart

 Are renounced, the mortal becomes immortal.

 When all the knots that strangle the heart

 Are loosened, the mortal becomes immortal.

 This sums up the teaching of the scriptures.

*****

They call us to the discovery of a realm deep within ourselves which is our native state:

*****

The sages understood this “bright body”; they knew firsthand that when the Self withdraws consciousness from the body, the continuity of personality is not broken.

*****

If personality returns life after life, then heaven too must be only a state of consciousness, part of the created world. It might last longer and be more blissful than bodily existence, but heaven too had to be transitory: a kind of interregnum in another loka or “world,” in which the Self can look back and learn from past mistakes.

*****

Thus Self-realization is immortality in an entirely new sense: not “everlasting life” but beyond death and life alike. In this state, when death comes, one sheds the body with no more rupture in consciousness than we feel in taking off a jacket at the end of the day.

*****

“There is enough in the world for everyone’s need; there is not enough for everyone’s greed.”

*****

materialism leads us to lose awareness of our inner life, which is bad enough; but to be hypnotized by our own feelings and sensations and forget about others and the world around us is worse.

*****

How can the multiplicity of life
Delude the one who sees its unity?

*****

In dark night live those for whom
--
I don't understand what the "dark night" refers to. They also reference a "darker night". Is it just a day night thing or do they mean something else? 

*****

The world without alone is real; in night
Darker still, for whom the world within
Alone is real. The first leads to a life
Of action, the second to a life of meditation.
--
Extroversion - life of Action
Introversion - life of Meditation 

*****

But those who combine action with meditation
Cross the sea of death through action
And enter into immortality
Through the practice of meditation.
--
Your actions will make you "cross the sea of death"
Your meditation will make you "immortal"

There seems to be a difference between the two, but isn't crossing the sea of death, immortality?

It seems like this is a 2 part thing. A mixture of the intelligence of Introversion and social success of extroversion.

I think it's leading to the point of "the ideas you leave behind makes you immortal". 

*****

In dark night live those for whom the Lord
Is transcendent only;
--
Where the extroverts live, there also live people who believe that God is something that's beyond nature. 

*****

in night darker still,
For whom he is immanent only.
--
With the introverts, God is everywhere in nature. 

*****

But those for whom he is transcendent
And immanent
--
Another synthesis of ideas. A mix between "god is in heaven" and "God is everywhere". 

*****

cross the sea of death
With the immanent and enter into
Immortality with the transcendent.
--
Interesting that this time cross the sea occurs with the idea related to the darker night, while immortality with the idea related to just the dark night. 

*****

As the Upanishads illustrate, the right questions are half the battle in life.

*****

“Now that I have seen your face,” he says to Death, “what can I enjoy?”

*****

The Self can be attained only by those
Whom the Self chooses. Verily unto them
Does the Self reveal himself.

*****

Know the Self as lord of the chariot,
The body as the chariot itself,
The discriminating intellect as
The charioteer, and the mind as reins.

*****

When a person lacks discrimination
And his mind is undisciplined, the senses
Run hither and thither like wild horses.
6 But they obey the rein like trained horses

*****

With a discriminating intellect
As charioteer and a trained mind as reins,
They attain the supreme goal of life,
To be united with the Lord of Love.

*****

The Self is hidden in the hearts of all,
As butter lies hidden in cream. Realize
The Self in the depths of meditation,
The Lord of Love, supreme reality,

*****

In deep meditation aspirants may
See forms like snow or smoke. They may feel
A strong wind blowing or a wave of heat.
They may see within them more and more light:
Fireflies, lightning, sun, or moon. These are signs
That they are well on their way to Brahman.

*****

Health, a light body, freedom from cravings,
A glowing skin, sonorous voice, fragrance
Of body: these signs indicate progress
In the practice of meditation.

*****

The study of the Vedas, linguistics,
Rituals, astronomy, and all the arts
Can be called lower knowledge. The higher
Is that which leads to Self-realization.

*****

Brahman cannot be realized by those
Who are subject to greed, fear, and anger.
Brahman cannot be realized by those
Who are subject to the pride of name and fame
Or to the vanity of scholarship.
Brahman cannot be realized by those
Who are enmeshed in life’s duality.

*****

“It is a fact established on the strength of the scriptures that speech and the other faculties are conscious through being presided over by conscious deities.”[10]

*****

Karma means primarily the spiritual or ethically operational residue of every act.

*****

It was Gandhi who really brought this abstruse doctrine back to vibrant life: act, by all means, but make your act, in the modern sense of the word, a sacrifice. That is, he explained, choose a selfless goal, use right means (nonviolence), and never be pushed into action for your own benefit – a tall order.

*****

as the Maitri Upanishad states, “One becomes like that which is in one’s mind – this is the everlasting secret”
