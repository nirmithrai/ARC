Learning through interconnected web of knowledge. (similar to [[zettelkasten]])


[[Construct]]:
"construct is the sum total of your web. It is how all the ideas fit together to create an understanding of a complex idea."

But that's not really a very good description. 
Sum total of you web - your entire knowledge base? Or just regarding the particular concept? Probably the latter. 

The goal of learning is to build this construct. 

If ideas (chunk of information) are bricks, concept is a house. A few missing bricks won't make a difference. You can solve problems from incomplete information when you have a construct. 


[[Model]]:
Model is a representation of the idea, an incomplete and temporary solution. You stich a bunch of models together to form a construct. 

Links->models->construct

3 techniques of holistic Learning:
1. [[Visceralization]]
Visualization is for seeing, visceralization is for feeling. Making the abstract tangible as an experience. Using all the senses to grap a concept. 
You visceralize with the help of an author when reading a book. Do this for abstract concepts by yourself. 
Use a pen and paper to draw out relationships between ideas to start with. No need to be perfect, just serviceable. Eventually use your imagination to do it. 

Visceralization is the key process to develop a model.

2. [[Metaphor]]
Can't develop a model for everything. Metaphor are a great way to link constructs together. 

Connecting unrelated ideas as that you can use the existing knowledge of one to understand the other. (there was a game design concept that was similar)

Whenever you learn something new, make a list of all the things it reminds you of even if it's completely unrelated. The point is link unrelated ideas. 

3. [[Explore]]
Going through constructs, models, metaphors and finding holes/errors by testing them. Polishing phase essentially. 
Test them by actually using the network and running problems through it. Studying also helps in pointing out missing points. 


Hammer and Nails:

Holistic Learning is only useful for learning concept and systems that already exists. (eg science, maths, health, economics, relationship, etc)
It cannot be used for rule based systems (eg Law), series of facts (eg spelling, vocabulary, history sometimes), skills (eg golf, guitar, drawing, etc)
