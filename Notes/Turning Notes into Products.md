Once you have a critical mass of notes, you will find clusters of notes around topics that interest you.

Once you have a collection of notes to turn into a product (article or book), first make an outline of the structure you want to go with. Then start refining by removing notes till you have a core.

This structure will turn into your Table of content that you can refer to know what to write. You'll never have to stare at a blank screen.

Then its just a matter of sorting the notes according to the structure and then rewriting it to make it flow better.
