Niklas Luhmann was a German Civil Servant who with the use of his knowledge management system [[Zettelkasten]] became one of the top Sociologists in the world.

The story goes that he would read a lot of books after he came home from work and whenever he found something he found interesting he made a note of it. Instead of categorizing them, he put a number in the corner and put it in a slipbox.

An idea is only as good as it's context and by remixing contexts of a given note, he would come upon new and novel ideas.

He could now essentially have a dialogue with his slipbox to get new ideas.

His big break came when he handed a manuscript to Helmut Schelsky, one of the most influential sociologist in Germany at the time. Helmut was so impressed he suggested Luhmann to become the professor of sociology at the University of Biefield.

In less than a year, with the power of his slipbox, Luhmann put together a doctoral thesis and a habilitation thesis. Shortly after that he was made the professor.

When asked what his main research project would be, he briefly stated:

> My Project: Theory of Society, Duration: 30 years, Cost: 0


This is the mother of all projects and he finished it almost exactly 30 years later titled "The Society of Society" (1997).

In 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles. Even after his death half a dozen more books were published from unfinished manuscripts.
