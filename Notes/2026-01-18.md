Need to think through this game. 
[[Journalist Simulator]]
The core mechanic is [[dialogue system]]
I need it to be fun with just the dialogue. So what can I do to make dialogue fun?
One thing is that this isn't a detective game. It is a journalist game. The player is not trying to solve the murder, just report on the murder. 

So say there's been a murder. A detective is on the case, trying to solve it. So the journalist would talk to the police and get their statement on the matter. Then talk to the victim's family and get their reactions. Perhaps talk to the accused and/or their lawyers too. They get the facts and quotes and then write an article about it. 

Ok so it's a lot of talking to people and then writing about it. So there's 2 parts here. Input and output.
Output is writing the article. Which is also a core mechanic. I want to think about it later, but i think it's too tied up with the input (conversations) to think about later.
