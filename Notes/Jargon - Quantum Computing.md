**Qubit**	
[[Quantum Bit]]. The basic unit of information in a quantum computer. Akin to bits in classical computers.

**Superposition**	
it is the ability of a qubit to be in multiple states at once. While a classical bit is 0 or 1, a qubit is said to be in a superposition between 0 and 1.

**Amplitude & Phase**	
`The complex numbers you actually control; they drive interference and algorithmic speed-ups.` 
Likely related to the amplitude and phase of waves. I think we use the wave nature of particles to do computation.

**Measurement** (Collapse)	
`Ends the quantum computation and spits out a classical bit—defines what counts as “output.”`
Unlike classical computers, qubits cannot be said to hold a particular value during calculation, rather it's all the values at once. When we measure it, it is said to collapse into a single value which we get as output but the qubit is destroyed (decohere) in the process.

**Entanglement**	
`The only way to get genuinely quantum correlations; essential for any multi-qubit power-up.`
It is linking of one qubit to another. When one collapse, the other one collapses to its opposite value, even if they are lightyears apart.

**Unitary Gate**	(Quantum Gate)
`Reversible matrix that moves qubit states around; every circuit instruction is one.`
A quantum logic gate that applies a "unitary matrix" to qubits. 

**Hadamard** (H)	
The canonical “create superposition” gate. 

**CNOT / Controlled-U**	
`Minimal two-qubit entangler; universality lives or dies here.`
Looks like a classical xor gate, acts like the NOT gate in practice. 

**Bloch Sphere**	
`Visual cheat-sheet for single-qubit states—keeps abstraction from floating off into math-land.`
A visual, geometric representation of a qubit.

**Decoherence** (T₁/T₂)	
Time limits on how long qubits stay useful. It loses its quantum properties like entanglement and superposition.
