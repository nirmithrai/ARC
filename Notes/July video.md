# Topic - Replaying Games

Not a replay kinda guy
Is that game really THAT good?
Time commitment for games is too long. 
Game mechanics don't change
Arcade games - pick up and play 
Change in difficulty might help
Achievements are a good motivator
Nostalgia is valid
Replay for the footage


# Draft
Welcome to dualEntropy

Death Stranding 2 came out recently but unfortunately it's a PS5 exclusive. I'm a PC guy and buying a PS5 just to play 1 game is ridiculous. (Unless it's gta 6). So I'm now forced to wait till it comes out on PC. 

DS2 is a ps5 exclusive 
Wait for pc release 
Hard wait cz I love the game
