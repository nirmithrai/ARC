# Current Goal
[[Test Room]]

# Core Principles 
- Data Driven Development. New content can be added by adding more data (assets, items, dialogues) rather than any code change. 
- UI tools to create this data (quest creator, )
- signals > autoloads 
- one way data flow. World emits events -> systems react -> UI updates. 
- deterministic time. WorldClock
