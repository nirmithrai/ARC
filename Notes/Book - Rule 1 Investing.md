99 Rule #1

We want to see a long history of great ROIC—at least 10 percent per year for the last ten years’ average.

*****

EPS is often called “the bottom line” (number) because it’s usually the last line on the financial statement

*****

Equity is what you and the kids would have left over if the kids sold off everything, paid off any debt, and took the money that was left.

*****

Since there are 2,000 shares and $28,000 to split up, each share would get $14. That $14 is called book value per share (BVPS) and the $28,000 is called equity or book value.

*****

the rate of equity growth could be identical and is very, very important. It tells us the business can accumulate surplus, and that in itself makes it exceptional. Hence, equity alone isn’t nearly as revealing as equity growth rate, which is why we focus more on the growth rate than on the numbers from which we derive the growth.

*****

The Rule on Debt: To determine whether a business’s debt is reasonable, find out if it can pay off its debt within three years by dividing total long-term debt by current free cash flow.

What’s the significance of the valley beginning to become a mountain (I inserted an upright triangle at the spot)? Well, that’s the precise point when the big guys have been moving so much money into the stock for so long that a significant price move upward is imminent. That’s when we want to buy. At that point in time, our risk is lowest that the stock’s going to go down.

*****

Beginning of a mountain, time to buy. Beginning of a valley, time to sell.

*****

One of these lines is called the “buy line,” and the other is called the “sell line.” When the buy line crosses and gets on top of the sell line (I inserted an upright triangle), the Stochastic is signaling that the stock is going from oversold (too many sellers) to overbought. Time to buy.

*****

Buy line crosses up, buy. Buy line crosses down, sell.

*****

That signal is usually preceded by a crossing of the 14- and 5-day lines as an early warning that change is in the wind. That’s our buy sign. The 20th to 80th percentiles are just confirmations.

*****

When the price line crosses above the moving average line, buy. When the price line crosses below the moving average line, sell.
