A Main Note has to be

-   Atomic The note has to be brief. Containing only one idea per note. Any other adjacent ideas can be linked to the note.
-   Standalone The note has to be understandable even without the context from which it was taken from.
-   True to Context Even though we strip out the context, we should not falsely represent the original context it was taken from. The author's meaning should be preserved.
-   Connected A good note will be connected to many other notes, ideally taken from different topics. This can be direct linking to other notes or linking by the way of arranging a note next to another with a similar idea.
-   Interest Driven Just following our interest should be the guide to notes of what topics should be added.
-   Written Everyday Maybe not everyday, but should be a day or two close to the literature or fleeting notes, so that we don't forget the context it was being taken from.
-   Not Copied We need to write the notes in our own words and not just copy quotes from the book. This rewriting requires understanding of the text and acts as a test to ensure proper learning.
-   Argued and Questioned Never take any information in the box for granted. Asking questions will open up new lines of inquires which will further contribute to the slipbox.
-   Sourced Know where the information came from.
