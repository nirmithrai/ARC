to the animals and plants.
His material body
is the source of visible light,
and, if there be such a thing as a substance
not perceptible to the senses,
the light of the sun
must contain that substance.

and skill is the force which creates order.

They brought humanity divine religion
and stopped the savagery
of mutual slaughter.

They taught men to swathe
the decaying corpses of the dead.

that the impure soul endures?

*****

Mind is the fifth part,
which comes from Light,
--
Light is electromagnetic and so is the electricity in the brain

*****

For belief grows from contemplation,
and disbelief from lack of thought.
