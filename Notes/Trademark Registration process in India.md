In India, the process for registering a trademark for a brand name involves the following steps:

Trademark search: You should conduct a search to ensure that your proposed brand name is available for registration. You can do this through the [[Indian Trademark Registry]]'s online database or hire a trademark attorney to conduct the search for you.
The cost of conducting a trademark search through the Indian Trademark Registry's online database is minimal, typically ranging from INR 500 to INR 1,000 (approximately USD 7 to USD 14).

Filing the trademark application: You can file your trademark application online with the Indian Trademark Registry through their e-filing system. The application should include the proposed brand name, the goods and services for which the trademark will be used, and other relevant details.
The cost of filing a trademark application in India varies depending on the number of classes of goods and services you wish to register the trademark for. The official government fees for filing a trademark application in India for one class is INR 9,000 (approximately USD 125) for individuals and small businesses, and INR 18,000 (approximately USD 250) for others. Additional classes will incur extra fees.

Examination of the application: After filing the application, the Indian Trademark Registry will examine it to ensure that it complies with the trademark rules and regulations. If there are any issues with the application, the Registry will issue an examination report, which you will need to respond to within one month.
