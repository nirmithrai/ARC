This should be one of the first things i figure out. I don't want to keep resetting progress everytime.

# questions??
How do I save my progress?
How do I continue?
What does a minimal version of the framework look like for micro interest? Eg. Install arch on my work laptop.
Will i need to do any maintenance on the obsidian page?
# major points

1. avoid progress resetting
2. eliminate interest waning. Once I do something I start losing interest on it. [[Hype Stage]] might be helpful to keep it going.
3. make atomic progress. I want to be able to do a tiny thing everyday and still make progress 
4. fit into my chaotic schedule. Should be able to make progress any time (as long as I have the tools for that specific interest )
5. have low overhead. The more meta things i have to do the less likely I'll do something. It introduces a lot of friction that compounds over time 
6. fun. The process itself should be so much fun and addictive that I **look forward** to it.
7. go from learning to doing. I learn more by doing so learning should have a direct result into action.
8. feed into each other. 
9. Forgiving. Not making it somedays should not affect the next day.


# For writing Ideas down
## Heading -> bullet points -> paragraphs -> action/output

Headings are quick and easy, satisfying #3. Bullet points as well. Then one para per day for a bullet point seems fine. 
For output I'll need to sit down, but that's fine i think. 
I might need a place to collect all the action items for a particular interest. Todoist will be best. I can divide each action by how long it will take. 
[[MAKE A LIST. SCHEDULE IT]]
## ? mins, 5 mins, 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr

Anything more means I need to split the work even more. Even 1 hr is pushing it. If the task is that big, the overhead of splitting it up is easier to swallow. I removed 1 min slab, it will take longer to write than do, so I should just do the thing. Even 5 mins is something I could just sit and do, but like 1 hr, I'll keep it. 


# Things I want to do/learn
1. Pixel art
2. Music production for games
3. Story writing 
4. Animation 
5. Quantum computing 
6. Game development 
7. Content creation 
8. Machine learning 
9. Person Finance 
10. Investing
11. Advertising and marketing 
12. 

I can make these each its own page and put them in an index page ( [[INTERESTS]] ) or front page from where I can access them. I need to track what progress I've made and what I need to do next to make progress. So past and future. Maybe even a present for things that I'm currently doing which will take more than 1 session to finish. 
The flow would be, take a topic from the future, put it into present and work on it. Once it's done, you put it into the past. 

Have a template for "Interest Page"
Past

Present 
[Structure of {Interest}]
Future


It's important that this be broad. Too granular and it becomes a todo list. These are not tasks to be finished, these are progress markers/milestones. 

I need to define what's in each page??
Is it notes? Guides? 

# Interest cross pollination 
Maybe a page that describes how some interests cross over and how to leverage one with another.

Eg. Animation could be improved by syncing to music. 

So how would I connect the two? Should I just wait for the realisations to come on their own? If yes, how do I capture them? How do I capture at all? Should I use Tags to indicate what interest they belong to? Or backlinks?


# How do I Capture 
Google keep -> obsidian

# how do I make it FUN?
Take inspiration from Duolingo, freeletics. These two apps have made it fun to do stuff on it. 
They embrace randomness. I like not looking at what workout I will do in freeletics and going in blind. So there no creating excuses for skipping a day, or rather a reduction of excuse creation. 
So for this i need to have a pool of tasks I can do and a way to pick them at random. I can even have filters so that it doesn't show things I can't do rn. 


# Anti-waning mechanisms
How do I track progress? 
Momentum capture through streaks? How does it relate to the Habits app I use? What can I learn from that?
How do I set up [[Hype Stage]] for each interest?


# (Sub) Interests
How do I define sub interests? Or even what am interest is? 
Is wizard core its own interest? Or is it part of game dev? How much of the interests framework does it inherit?
Does every YouTube video I make deserve its own interest or is that too much over head?


# Tool Accessibility 
What tools are mandatory for an interest??
What are optional??
What the minimum I need to do something??


# Books
How do I make use of the books I'm reading??
How does it fit into the framework??
How do I process the imported highlights??
How do I do it in an atomic way??


# When do I do it?
For most of the habits I've stuck with, I have a set time when I do them. Duolingo when I wake up, workout at 6, meditation after bath, journal and what ever I missed before bed. 


# different types of outputs
YouTube video 
Blog Post? Essay?
Game
Short story


# Framework improvement
I need a place to put down what's going well and what's causing issues with the framework.


# Random ideas
Every new interest page starts with Future. You make a list of things you want to do for this interest. 
Group it based on if you can do them in any order. 
Eg.
Task1
Task2
Task3

Task4
Task5

Task6

In this example, task 1, 2 and 3 can be done in any order, and task 4 and 5 can be done in any order, 1, 2 and 3 to be finished before 4 and 5 can be started. And 6 needs 4 and 5 to be finished. 
It's not perfect, blockers are never as linear as this example, but the idea is to just group together tasks that can be done in any order. Maybe task 5 is only blocked by task3 and once 3 is done, it can move up to the first group.


# Levels
Have different levels to it and I have to complete an exam to graduate to the next level. So I can maybe research "what does it take to be an intermediate or expert in this field?". Then I can set myself an exam or a criteria or a task I have to complete to finish that level.

Level 0 is Understanding the interest.
What it is, jargon, tools, philosophies 
Who's who in the field. Learn from the best
Collect Resources 
Set the path towards mastery. What are the levels? What are the exams? What is the end goal?
What do I do if I get stuck?
What are some good and bad habits?
Hype stage. What made me get into it? How can I reinvigorate my want to continue?
When does level 0 end??
