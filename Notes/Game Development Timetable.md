## Programming (Gameplay & Tech)
### Study 
- sucessful projects
- Save/Load 
- engine docs
- UI implementation (HUD/menus wiring)
- Performance (profiling & optimization)
- AI/Pathfinding 
- Shader/procedural graphics study 

### Practice 
- Build 
	- tiny prototypes
	- Tools/pipeline utility (importers, batchers)
- Maintainance 
	- Refactor
	- cleanup
	- debug
	- document 
- Test
	- write unit tests
	- integration tests
- automate 
	- Scripts
	- CI/CD 
	- versioning 
- Experiment
	- NPC AI behaviour 
	- physics engine
	- plugins and add-ons 


## Art & Animation
### Study 
- UV/texture/material 
- Lighting & composition 
- Style guide & references curation
- Animation study (cycles, timing/spacing)
- UI art kit exploration (icons, frames, typographic hierarchy)
- level dressing / scene blockout 

### Practice 
- Curate
	- style guide
	- references
	- icons
	- typography 
- Modeling 
	- Hard Surface
	- Soft Surface 
	- Animal
	- Nature
	- Human
- Experiment / explore 
	- Asset pipeline (export/import, LODs)
	- Color/value/shape language
	- VFX sketching (particles, screen FX)
	

## Audio (Music & SFX)
[[I know nothing about audio or music for video games Where do I start with this]]

### Study
- SFX design study (foley/synthesis)
- Sample/library organization & tagging
- Ambience/atmosphere beds
- Ear training & reference matching
- Noise control & cleanup (EQ, dynamics)
- UI/feedback sound set pass


### Practice
- Music sketching (motifs, loops, chord palettes)
- Adaptive/interactive audio logic sketch
- Mixing & loudness pass (headroom, bus routing)
- Implementation practice (events, cues, RTPCs/buses)

## Writing & Narrative

### Study
- Premise/worldbuilding scaffold
- Scene beat outline (setup→turn→payoff)
- Lore bible upkeep (terms, timeline, factions)
- Narrative systems notes (codex, logs, tooltips)
- Quest/mission skeletons (beats, fail states)
- Branching structure mapping (nodes, flags)

### Practice
- Character sheets & voice exploration
- Dialogue practice (banter, barks, economy of words)
- Tone/voice/style experiments
- Naming pass (items, places, abilities)

## Game Design
### Study
- Reverse-design teardown (loops, verbs, economies)
- Difficulty curve & onboarding plan
- Juice/feedback audit (responses, telegraphing)
- Level design blockout study (flow, affordances)
- Progression & reward mapping (meta goals)
- Accessibility pass (input, readability, fail-forward)
- Mechanic variations & constraints (one-button, no UI, etc.)

### Practice
- Core loop drafting (goal→action→feedback→growth)
- Paper prototype (tokens/cards/dice or simple UI mock)
- Economy/balance sketch (costs, sinks, pacing)

## Production / Business / “Solo Studio Ops”
**Go through each decipline and set up next steps** 
### Study
- Risk assessment (identify→mitigate)
- Competition/market scan
- Store pages
- game trailers 
- marketing avenues
- ad cost analysis 

### Practice 
- Plan
	- Weekly plan
	- Backlog grooming
	- priority pruning
	- Milestone/roadmap 
- Test
	- Play test
	- log bugs
	- document improvements
- Review
	- obsidian 
	- Budget/Cost Analysis 
	- Time Tracking 
	- Energy and mood check in
	- weekly reflection
