The Psychology of Money
Morgan Housel

#book_notes 

My aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweat shops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor” working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she worked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute.
The idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies.
That is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs.

Buying a lottery ticket is the only time in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the good stuff that you already have and take for granted.

*****

Luck and risk are siblings.

*****

“Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”

*****

Bill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up at Lakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk by never getting to finish what he and Gates set out to achieve. The same force, the same magnitude, working in opposite directions.

*****

You can praise Vanderbilt for flouting the law with as much passion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhaps one got lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the other found itself on the side of risk.

*****

Risk and luck are doppelgangers.

*****

Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.

*****

Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns

*****

people who have control over their time tend to be happier in life

*****

“Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”

*****

There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.

*****

The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

*****

Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.

*****

Social comparison is the problem here.

*****

“The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit as soon as you enter.”

*****

“Enough” is not too little.

*****

There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.

*****

The big takeaway from ice ages is that you don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results.

*****

His skill is investing, but his secret is time.

*****

good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated.

*****

There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so.
But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.

*****

Getting money is one thing.
Keeping it is another.

*****

It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.

*****

There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money.
One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over.
The other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitive math of compounding.

*****

1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.

*****

Compounding doesn’t rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time—especially in times of chaos and havoc—will always win.

*****

2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.

*****

Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance.

*****

3. A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.

*****

Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.

*****

The idea that a few things account for most results is not just true for companies in your investment portfolio. It’s also an important part of your own behavior as an investor.

*****

CEO Jeff Bezos said shortly after the disastrous launch of the company’s Fire Phone:
If you think that’s a big failure, we’re working on much bigger failures right now. I am not kidding. Some of them are going to make the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip.

*****

At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2013 Warren Buffett said he’s owned 400 to 500 stocks during his life and made most of his money on 10 of them. Charlie Munger followed up: “If you remove just a few of Berkshire’s top investments, its long-term track record is pretty average.”

*****

The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”

*****

Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.

*****

When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.”

*****

It’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine.

*****

Rich is a current income.

*****

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and setting your own goals.

*****

Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don’t think they can save, and those who don’t think they need to save.

*****

The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.

*****

Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.
More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.

*****

There are professional investors who grind 80 hours a week to add a tenth of a percentage point to their returns when there are two or three full percentage points of lifestyle bloat in their finances that can be exploited with less effort

*****

Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

*****

Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.

*****

So people’s ability to save is more in their control than they might think.

*****

Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable.

*****

“Things that have never happened before happen all the time.”

*****

A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.

*****

Two dangerous things happen when you rely too heavily on investment history as a guide to what’s going to happen next.

*****

1. You’ll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.

*****

The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising

*****

2. History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn’t account for structural changes that are relevant to today’s world.

*****

For our argument it doesn’t particularly matter what caused the change. What matters is that things clearly changed.

*****

An interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back you look, the more likely you are to be examining a world that no longer applies to today.

*****

investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’”

*****

Michael Batnick put it: “The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’”

*****

The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be.

*****

You have to plan on your plan not going according to plan.

*****

History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas.

*****

“the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.”

*****

The biggest gains occur infrequently, either because they don’t happen often or because they take time to compound.

*****

What if you need to cash out your retirement accounts in your 30s to pay for a medical mishap?

*****

For my own investments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average.

*****

An important cousin of room for error is what I call optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstances.

*****

Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin.

*****

I just want to ensure I can remain standing long enough for my risks to pay off. You have to survive to succeed.

*****

You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because they happen more often than you think and you have no plan for how to deal with them.

*****

If there’s one way to guard against their damage, it’s avoiding single points of failure.

*****

But it’s equally important to save for things you can’t possibly predict or even comprehend—the financial equivalent of field mice.

*****

the most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.

*****

Charlie Munger says the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

*****

rather than one 80-something-year lifespan, our money has perhaps four distinct 20-year blocks.

*****

We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning.

*****

Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum.

*****

We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds.

*****

“When I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had never written an earlier draft,” Zweig continued, “he said the words I’ve never forgotten: ‘I have no sunk costs.’”49

*****

Everything has a price, and the key to a lot of things with money is just figuring out what that price is and being willing to pay it.
The problem is that the price of a lot of things is not obvious until you’ve experienced them firsthand, when the bill is overdue.

*****

Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd.

*****

Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price.

*****

Dow Jones Industrial Average returned about 11% per year from 1950 to 2019, which is great. But the price of success during this period was dreadfully high. The shaded lines in the chart show when it was at least 5% below its previous all-time high.

*****

Market returns are never free and never will be.

*****

The volatility/uncertainty fee—the price of returns—is the cost of admission to get returns greater than low-fee parks like cash and bonds.

*****

An idea exists in finance that seems innocent but has done incalculable damage.
It’s the notion that assets have one rational price in a world where investors have different goals and time horizons.

*****

Ask yourself: How much should you pay for Google stock today?
The answer depends on who “you” are.
Do you have a 30-year time horizon? Then the smart price to pay involves a sober analysis of Google’s discounted cash flows over the next 30 years.
Are you looking to cash out within 10 years? Then the price to pay can be figured out by an analysis of the tech industry’s potential over the next decade and whether Google management can execute on its vision.
Are you looking to sell within a year? Then pay attention to Google’s current product sales cycles and whether we’ll have a bear market.
Are you a day trader? Then the smart price to pay is “who cares?” because you’re just trying to squeeze a few bucks out of whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can be accomplished at any price.

*****

Bubbles aren’t so much about valuations rising. That’s just a symptom of something else: time horizons shrinking as more short-term traders enter the playing field.

*****

Bubbles do their damage when long-term investors playing one game start taking their cues from those short-term traders playing another.

*****

These two investors rarely even know that each other exist. But they’re on the same field, running toward each other. When their paths blindly collide, someone gets hurt.

*****

It’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own.

*****

“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell.”
—Historian Deirdre McCloskey

*****

But pessimism holds a special place in our hearts. Pessimism isn’t just more common than optimism. It also sounds smarter. It’s intellectually captivating, and it’s paid more attention than optimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk.

*****

Real optimists don’t believe that everything will be great. That’s complacency. Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way.

*****

Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism.

*****

One is that money is ubiquitous, so something bad happening tends to affect everyone and captures everyone’s attention.

*****

There are two topics that will affect your life whether you are interested in them or not: money and health.

*****

Another is that pessimists often extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt

*****

A third is that progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.

*****

Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.

*****

“I don’t get it,” he says. “I’ve seen the cities. I’ve looked at the factories. You guys have the same knowledge, the same tools, the same ideas. Nothing has changed! Why are you poorer? Why are you more pessimistic?”
There was one change the alien couldn’t see between 2007 and 2009: The stories we told ourselves about the economy.

*****

In 2009 we inflicted narrative damage on ourselves, and it was vicious. It’s one of the most potent economic forces that exists.

*****

1. The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.

*****

Medicine predates useful medicine by thousands of years.

*****

Why do people listen to TV investment commentary that has little track record of success? Partly because the stakes are so high in investing. Get a few stock picks right and you can become rich without much effort. If there’s a 1% chance that someone’s prediction will come true, and it coming true will change your life, it’s not crazy to pay attention—just in case

*****

This is a big part of why room for error, flexibility, and financial independence—important themes discussed in previous chapters—are indispensable.

*****

you think a recession is coming and you cash out your stocks in anticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going to be warped by what you want to happen.

*****

2. Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps

*****

Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.

*****

I once calculated that if you just assume that the market goes up every year by its historic average, your accuracy is better than if you follow the average annual forecasts of the top 20 market strategists from large Wall Street banks

*****

“Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.”

*****

The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty

*****

Kahneman once laid out the path these stories take:
When planning we focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others whose decisions might affect our outcomes.
Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck.
We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.

*****

For most of history the ethos of medicine was that the doctor’s job was to fix the patient, and what the patient thought about the doctor’s treatment plans wasn’t relevant.

*****

Financial advisors are the same. There are universal truths in money, even if people come to different conclusions about how they want to apply those truths to their own finances.

*****

Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong.

*****

Less ego, more wealth.

*****

Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.

*****

If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.

*****

Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes.

*****

Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and losers appear more regrettable than they should.

*****

Use money to gain control over your time,

*****

Be nicer and less flashy.

*****

Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save.

*****

saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save.

*****

Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.

*****

Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free

*****

Worship room for error.

*****

Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions.

*****

You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time.

*****

Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game.

*****

Respect the mess

*****

Half of all U.S. mutual fund portfolio managers do not invest a cent of their own money in their funds, according to Morningstar.69

*****

Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.”

*****

Not being forced to sell stocks to cover an expense also means we’re increasing the odds of letting the stocks we own compound for the longest period of time. Charlie Munger put it well: “The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.”

*****

Simple investment strategies can work great as long as they capture the few things that are important to that strategy’s success.
