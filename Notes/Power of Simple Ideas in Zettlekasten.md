Zettelkasten system is built on simple ideas.

There are multiple steps, but each step in itself is simple

1.  read
2.  fleeting notes
3.  permanent notes
4.  Slipbox notes
5.  product/article

Even inside the slipbox this philosophy prevails.

-   Each note is supposed to be atomic and self explanatory
-   Each of the notes are to be linked by their apparent proximity to each other
