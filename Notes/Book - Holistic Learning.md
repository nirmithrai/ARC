[[Book Notes]] from Keep Notes

Learning through interconnected web of knowledge. (similar to [[zettelkasten]])


[[Construct]]:
"construct is the sum total of your web. It is how all the ideas fit together to create an understanding of a complex idea."

But that's not really a very good description. 
Sum total of you web - your entire knowledge base? Or just regarding the particular concept? Probably the latter. 

The goal of learning is to build this construct. 

If ideas (chunk of information) are bricks, concept is a house. A few missing bricks won't make a difference. You can solve problems from incomplete information when you have a construct. 


[[Model]]:
Model is a representation of the idea, an incomplete and temporary solution. You stich a bunch of models together to form a construct. 

Links->models->construct

3 techniques of holistic Learning:
1. [[Visceralization]]
Visualization is for seeing, visceralization is for feeling. Making the abstract tangible as an experience. Using all the senses to grap a concept. 
You visceralize with the help of an author when reading a book. Do this for abstract concepts by yourself. 
Use a pen and paper to draw out relationships between ideas to start with. No need to be perfect, just serviceable. Eventually use your imagination to do it. 

Visceralization is the key process to develop a model.

2. [[Metaphor]]
Can't develop a model for everything. Metaphor are a great way to link constructs together. 

Connecting unrelated ideas as that you can use the existing knowledge of one to understand the other. (there was a game design concept that was similar)

Whenever you learn something new, make a list of all the things it reminds you of even if it's completely unrelated. The point is link unrelated ideas. 

3. [[Explore]]
Going through constructs, models, metaphors and finding holes/errors by testing them. Polishing phase essentially. 
Test them by actually using the network and running problems through it. Studying also helps in pointing out missing points. 


Hammer and Nails:

Holistic Learning is only useful for learning concept and systems that already exists. (eg science, maths, health, economics, relationship, etc)
It cannot be used for rule based systems (eg Law), series of facts (eg spelling, vocabulary, history sometimes), skills (eg golf, guitar, drawing, etc)

# Highlighted 

Your goal when learning any complex subject or field should be to build a construct. A framework of understanding in which your web of knowledge occupies.

*****

The beauty of having a construct and not a memorized list of information is constructs are much easier to maintain

*****

When you have a construct, you can solve difficult problems even when there is a lot of missing information. You simply look at your construct, see where the holes point to and fill them in

*****

Trying to understand everything at once is impossible for the conscious mind to handle. Building individual models can give you a chance to stitch them together into a complete construct.

*****

Even if the model was inaccurate, I could use it as a basis for refining and expanding the eventual construct

*****

A model isn’t a grouping of ideas, it’s an experience

*****

you want to summarize concepts and ideas with a specific image or feeling

*****

More than just a picture, you want an experience

*****

Visceralizing means taking a handful of concepts and turning them into a single workable experience

*****

Draw out the relationship between several ideas in a picture. Remember your goal isn’t a perfect construct but a simplified model.  Even if your model is shown to be slightly inaccurate later, it is still better than no model at all.

*****

It can take time to develop a unique model and this can be wasted when you are lost, facing a problem for which you lack the proper instruction and constructs to handle. To interlink constructs you need to use metaphor

*****

You want to connect two ideas together even though they aren’t really related

*****

If you don’t already use metaphors extensively, a quick way to start would be to play the, “That Reminds Me Of...”
“That Reminds Me Of...” game whenever you learn something new. You play the game by thinking or writing down a list of ideas that this new concept reminds you of. It doesn’t matter if the ideas are ridiculous or completely unrelated. That’s the point, to link together ideas that don't normally connect.

*****

Exploration is the process of going through your constructs, models and metaphors and finding errors. Consider this to be the polishing phase of your final understanding.  Scrap models that don’t represent what you’ve learned and fill holes for where you lack understanding

*****

Holes and errors will only come up when you actually go back and test them.  Until you actually review the information involved, they will be hidden from your awareness

*****

The best way to explore is to actually face problems.

*****

Having to actually use your network will quickly point out holes and errors

*****

Holistic learning assumes you already have a construct and practice questions are just to fill holes. If you end up having to do the same type of question many times to understand it, you need to step back, create some new models and rebuild your construct.

*****

The second best way to explore is to study

*****

Studying isn’t as good as testing but it can fix a few broken paths.

*****

Holistic learning works best when there is an underlying system to be understood

*****

holistic learning breaks down is where no construct really exists

*****

Law is a great example. 
 Although there are some weak constructs that can be applied to laws, they are weak and arbitrary. One cannot assume a law exists based on the linking of similar laws. Rule based systems that are highly arbitrary require other skills that holistic learning doesn’t cover.

*****

Spelling, vocabulary and languages often have similarly weak potential for forming constructs

*****

Skills are learned subconsciously and don’t benefit much from holistic learning
