Mikhail is an absolute sweetheart

I wish the camera was a bit further back. Its too zoomed in for the game.

The desert sun level was really cool (heh). Even the bones lying around. I wish the camera was a bit farther so i could enjoy it more.

Read some of the supplemental materials. A manga and the novelletes. Getting to know the characters more is a delight. 

The chakra is awful. The aim mode doesnt work half the time. 

The ghosts suck 

Item pickup range is very small

The Ending B is really dumb. Why didn't he Reincarnate?

There are so many plot holes in ending c im not even gonna bother thinking about it.


Yeah the final ending thing is impossible, couldnt even get one. Im not gonna bother with it. Cool idea though.

This game had a lot of cool boss fights. But thw regular enemies were very very annoying, especially when they throw in some nasty combinations. Getting hit from off camera is always shitty. 

The game got significantly harder after the firat ending. Maybe its because i stopped doing Sidequests, mayne its because i didnt bother upgrading any weapons.
