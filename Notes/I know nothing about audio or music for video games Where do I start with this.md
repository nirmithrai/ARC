You're starting from the right question. Game audio is its own deep discipline — _not just about music_, but about **crafting an interactive soundscape**. Since you're learning solo, and since you like structure and discipline breakdowns, here's a clear path from zero knowledge to making usable game audio.

## 🔰 THE BIG THREE OF GAME AUDIO

There are 3 core disciplines you’ll eventually want to grasp:

1. **Music Composition** – Making background music (BGM) and thematic tracks.
2. **Sound Design** – Making SFX: footsteps, gunshots, UI bleeps, ambient noise, etc.
3. **Implementation** – Putting sounds into the game engine properly (looping, spatial audio, transitions, etc.).

You don’t need to master all 3 at once — but they’re all essential for a real game.

## 🧠 START HERE: STAGE 0 – Ear Training & Exposure

You’re likely missing the internal “sound vocabulary” that lets you analyze or reproduce what you hear. Fix that first.

**Daily/weekly practices:**

- **Critical listening:**  
    Pick a game soundtrack you like → pick 1 track → answer:
    
    - What instruments do you hear?
    - Is it melodic or ambient?
    - How does it loop? When does it change?
    - What emotion is it pushing?
- **SFX breakdown:**  
    Watch 1 minute of a cutscene or gameplay (with no music) and write down _every_ sound you notice. Then try to guess:
    
    - Was it recorded (foley)?
    - Synthesized (electronic)?
    - Layered from other sounds?
- **Looping practice:**  
    Open a song in an audio editor (Audacity works) and try to loop it seamlessly. This is surprisingly non-trivial.

## 🛠 STAGE 1 – Toy Project: Ambient Soundscape

Start by building an **ambient loop** in your game engine (e.g. Godot):

1. Pick a setting (e.g. forest, dungeon, spaceship).
2. Download some ambient sounds from freesound.org (or use Godot’s sample assets).
3. Layer background noise, wind, and some interactive sounds (footsteps, doors).
4. Trigger the sounds with basic game logic (e.g. walk into a bush → rustle).

This skips music composition entirely and focuses on the **implementation + sound design** part. Way more beginner-friendly.

## 🎼 STAGE 2 – Learn Music Creation Basics

If you want to try making music:

- Install a free DAW (Digital Audio Workstation):
    
    - **LMMS** (Linux-friendly)
    - **Cakewalk** (Windows)
    - **GarageBand** (Mac)
    - **Reaper** (free trial, full features)
- Start with **loop-based composition**:
    
    - Use built-in instrument loops
    - Modify them, arrange them
    - Try to create a 30-second looping background track
- Focus on **mood and pacing**:
    
    - Fast/tense? Slow/melancholy? Peaceful?
    - Use tempo, instrument choice, and rhythm to convey it

**Avoid jumping straight into music theory.** You can add that later.

## 🔊 STAGE 3 – Learn Sound Design Basics

This is about creating sound effects, not music.

### Tools:

- **Audacity** (Free) – basic editing
- **Surge XT** or **Vital** (Free synths) – for creating electronic sounds
- **Freesound.org** – for raw source files

### Exercises:

- Record your own sounds (voice, objects), then pitch/warp them
- Make a “menu UI” sound set: click, hover, back, confirm
- Make a “platformer” sound set: jump, land, collect coin

## 🧩 STAGE 4 – Learn Audio Implementation in Godot

Since you’re using Godot, you’ll want to explore:

- **AudioStreamPlayer vs AudioStreamPlayer3D**
- **Area triggers for sound (e.g. enter zone → play loop)**
- **Bus system (e.g. music vs SFX vs UI channels)**
- **Reverb zones**
- **Fading and transitions between tracks**

Godot’s audio system is _good enough_ for most games and has native support for almost everything you’ll need.

Later, you can explore FMOD or Wwise for advanced implementation, but that's overkill for now.

## ⏳ If You Have One Day a Week…

Here’s what a beginner progression could look like:

**WEEK 1–2:**

- Passive listening exercises
- Make ambient scenes with preexisting sounds

**WEEK 3–4:**

- Build your first 30s ambient music loop
- Create UI sound effects

**WEEK 5–6:**

- Integrate music and SFX into your Godot prototype
- Add simple fade-ins/outs and looping

**WEEK 7–8:**

- Try making a full level with a reactive soundscape: changing BGM, footsteps on different surfaces, etc.

## 📚 Good Resources

- **YouTube Channels**
    
    - Alex Moukala (music theory + game analysis)
    - Marshall McGee (sound design)
    - David Dumais (FMOD / Wwise tutorials)
    - Blipsounds (interactive audio)
- **Books (optional later)**
    
    - _The Game Audio Tutorial_ – Richard Stevens & David Raybould
    - _A Composer’s Guide to Game Music_ – Winifred Phillips

## 💬 TL;DR

> Start by listening better. Then learn how to _use_ sound before you try to _create_ it. Start with ambient and interactive audio, then dip into music. Let tools like Godot and free DAWs guide your learning through hands-on loops and small experiments.

If you're ready, I can help you:

- Set up your learning tasks like you did with the other disciplines (daily/weekly categories)
- Build a small Godot project to practice
- Recommend a DAW and starter sound pack
