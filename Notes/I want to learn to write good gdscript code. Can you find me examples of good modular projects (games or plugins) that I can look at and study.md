Absolutely. Here‚Äôs a tight, curated set of open-source Godot 4 projects (mostly pure GDScript) that are modular, readable, and worth dissecting. I grouped them by ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôll learn‚Äù.

### Full, modular starter projects

* **Cogito (Immersive-sim template)** ‚Äî data-driven inventory, menus, interactables, quests; very clean scene/service split and mostly GDScript. Great for seeing many systems talk cleanly. ([GitHub][1])
* **Crystal Bit ‚Äì Godot Game Template** ‚Äî opinionated project skeleton (folders, services, CI, input, options). Use this to benchmark your own project structure. ([GitHub][2])

### Large real apps in GDScript (excellent architecture study)

* **Pixelorama** ‚Äî a full pixel editor built in Godot 4; tons of editor tools, plugin-like modules, signal-driven UI, and testable subsystems. (Entirely GDScript.) ([GitHub][3], [Orama Interactive][4])
* **Material Maker** ‚Äî node-based material authoring tool in Godot; study its data models, graph UI, and tool scripts. ([GitHub][5], [Godot Engine][6])

### Dialogue & narrative stacks

* **Dialogic 2** ‚Äî complete dialogue/visual novel framework; inspect how it persists state, uses resources, and exposes editor tooling. ([GitHub][7])
* **Nathan Hoad‚Äôs Dialogue Manager** ‚Äî lean, well-tested dialogue system; idiomatic GDScript, clear separation (balloons, runners, resources). ([GitHub][8])

### Quests / RPG data / composition

* **Pandora (RPG data management)** ‚Äî data-driven items, abilities, NPCs, quests with a dedicated editor UI; very ‚Äúsystems first‚Äù and unit-tested. (Alpha but already a great pattern study.) ([GitHub][9])
* **ShomyKohai Quest System** ‚Äî modern Godot 4.4+ quest addon; resource-based design with a modular API. See the ‚Äúadvanced example‚Äù combining Pandora + Dialogue Manager. ([GitHub][10])

### AI patterns (state/BT/steering)

* **Beehave (Behavior Trees)** ‚Äî GDScript behavior trees with editor/debugger and tests; shows how to build a complex addon cleanly. ([GitHub][11])
* **XSM (State Machine)** ‚Äî production-proven finite state machine addon; study the API surface and how it avoids inheritance tangles. ([Reddit][12])
* **GDQuest Steering AI Framework** ‚Äî classic steering behaviors organized as reusable components. ([Reddit][13])

### Core gameplay systems (drop-in, well-structured)

* **Expressobits Inventory System (Godot 4)** ‚Äî lightweight, readable inventory service with clear boundaries; good ‚Äúservices + resources‚Äù example. ([GitHub][14])
* **Expressobits Character Controller (2D/3D)** ‚Äî modular locomotion controllers; study input ‚Üí state ‚Üí motion separation. ([GitHub][15])

### Project-level patterns & testing

* **GUT (Godot Unit Test)** ‚Äî the testing addon most teams lean on; read the tests in projects above and mirror the patterns. ([GitHub][16])
* **Awesome-Godot** ‚Äî a living index of high-quality Godot games, templates, and plugins; use it to branch out once you‚Äôve absorbed the list above. ([GitHub][17])
* **Official Godot Demo Projects** ‚Äî bite-sized, idiomatic examples kept up to date; great for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the canonical way to do X?‚Äù. ([GitHub][18], [Godot Engine][19])

### How to study these (fast, surgical, and useful)

Don‚Äôt binge-read code. Treat each repo like a lab:

1. **Map the architecture (15‚Äì20 min)**
   Write a quick sketch of: *autoload services*, *resource types*, *signal graph*, *scene composition*. If you can‚Äôt name those for a repo, you didn‚Äôt learn it.

2. **Trace one vertical slice (30‚Äì40 min)**
   E.g., for Dialogue Manager: *input ‚Üí dialogue runner ‚Üí balloon ‚Üí UI*. For Pandora: *resource authoring ‚Üí runtime load ‚Üí system consuming it*. Step through signals, look at who owns state.

3. **Extract a micro-pattern (30 min)**
   Copy one idea into a tiny sandbox project:

* **Resources as data** (items/quests) ‚Üí load/instantiate at runtime.
* **Service singletons** (audio, save, time) ‚Üí inject via signals, not globals.
* **State/BT** (enemy/NPC) ‚Üí keep logic in small scripts, one responsibility each.
* **Tests** ‚Üí write one GUT test for a quest/flag/update.

Cap yourself at **90 minutes per repo**. Ship the micro-pattern into your current Godot project the same day; don‚Äôt hoard notes. (Yes, I‚Äôm pushing you out of the perfection loop.)

If you want, tell me which two systems you‚Äôre building first (e.g., **Dialogue + Quests** or **Inventory + NPC schedules**) and I‚Äôll pull the exact files/paths from 2‚Äì3 of the repos above and outline the glue code you should write next.
