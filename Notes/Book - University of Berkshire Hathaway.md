03 University of Berkshire Hathaway: 30 Years of Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger at the Annual Shareholders Meeting
Corey Wrenn, Daniel Pecaut
#book_notes 
In 1967, Buffett bought an insurance company, National Indemnity. Insurance has been a core operation at Berkshire Hathaway ever since. He loves the insurance business. With its float characteristics, it creates a powerful platform for compounding wealth.

*****

Insurance companies collect premiums, of which a significant portion goes into reserves to pay future claims. This reserve (the “float”) earns money for Berkshire, leveraging the company’s return on capital. If you can operate in a way where that float is generated at a low cost and you can grow it over time, you have built a wealth-compounding machine. As Munger once put it, “Basically, we’re a hedgehog that knows one big thing. If you generate float at 3% per annum and buy businesses that earn 13% per annum with the proceeds of that float, we have figured out that’s a pretty good position to be in.”

*****

It taught him about the power of brands and the virtues of companies that don’t require a lot of capital to grow. Selling chocolate doesn’t require a lot of innovation. It won’t become obsolete. If you have a good brand, customers will keep coming back every Valentine’s Day for more.

*****

During the first decade of the 21st century (a.k.a. “the lost decade”), Buffett was criticized for holding enormous amounts of cash and bonds. During the subprime mortgage crisis, Buffett and Munger went on an investing spree.

*****

When Corey started in internal audit, computers could be purchased online without paying sales tax. But, at Berkshire, if anything like that was purchased, it had to be reported to corporate, so they could file the use tax returns. Buffett wanted to make sure that Nebraska got their sales tax. He was adamant about making sure that Berkshire paid—not more taxes than it had to, but the taxes that it was responsible for.

*****

Highlights From 1986’s Notes

*****

Buffett’s philosophical framework. 
Value Investing

*****

Graham breaks the art of investing down into two simple variables—price and value. Value is what a business is worth. Price is what you have to pay to get it.

*****

Graham emphasizes a large margin of safety.

*****

On Intrinsic Business Value

*****

Buffett defines it as “what a company would bring if sold to a knowledgeable buyer.”

*****

On Inflation 
Buffett says it’s a political phenomena, not an economic one.

*****

True to Graham’s principles, Buffett said he pays no attention to economic outlooks. His decisions are based simply on intrinsic business values.

*****

Highlights From 1987’s Notes

*****

As Buffett points out in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report:
“ . . . occasional outbreaks of those two super-contagious diseases, fear and greed, will forever occur in the investment community. The timing of these epidemics will be unpredictable. And the market aberrations produced by them will be equally unpredictable, both as to duration and degree. Therefore, we never try to anticipate the arrival or departure of either disease. Our goal is more modest: we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.
As this is written, little fear is visible in Wall Street. Instead, euphoria prevails—and why not? What could be more exhilarating than to participate in a bull market in which the rewards to owners of businesses become gloriously uncoupled from the plodding performances of the businesses themselves. Unfortunately, however, stocks can’t outperform businesses indefinitely.”

*****

Buffett claimed that it is a terrible mistake to think that things out of a computer are precise. If you have to carry it out to three decimal places, it is too complicated.

*****

Keynes said, “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.”

*****

On the Ideal Business
Buffett: “Something that costs a penny, sells for a dollar and is habit forming.”

*****

Highlights From 1988’s Notes

*****

Real Estate
Munger: “Everyone talks about the big money made in realestate, but they forget to talk about the big money lost in real estate.”
Foreign Currencies
Munger: “It’s hard enough to understand the culture you’ve been raised in, much less someone else’s.”
Leverage
Buffett: “You can leverage up to your eyeballs, but you may not make it across the river.”
Hard Assets 
Munger: “Someone figured out the Van Gogh painting that sold for $40 million last year yielded a 13% compounded annualized return. Berkshire shareholders have done much better.”

*****

What can we do then to mitigate the effects of inflation? The same thing that Buffett and Munger would do if there were no inflation. We’d buy great businesses with excellent management at a fair to bargain price and leave them alone.

*****

Highlights From 1989’s Notes

*****

Buffett noted that if he and Munger get a value of X to 3X for an asset, then they attempt to buy it at 1/2X.2

*****

“If investors only had to study the past, the richest people would be librarians.”

*****

“It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” 
—WARREN BUFFETT

*****

Munger explained that the business schools are merely heeding Ben Franklin’s advice: “Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.”

*****

Highlights From 1991’s Notes

*****

Buffett has classified Berkshire’s holdings in Capital Cities/ABC, Coca-Cola, GEICO and the Washington Post as “permanent” and listed three characteristics for such holdings:
Good economic characteristics
Able and trustworthy management
We like what the company does

*****

Buffett noted that many investors illogically become euphoric when stock prices rise and are downcast when they fall. This makes no more sense than if you bought some hamburger one day, returned the next day to buy more but at a higher price, and then felt euphoric because you had bought some cheaper the day before. If you are going to be a lifelong buyer of food, you welcome falling prices and deplore price increases. So should it be with investments.

*****

Buffett explained that financial disasters come about because stupid decisions in financial companies are not accompanied by immediate pain. Instead, people give you more money. Seeing this, competitors indulge in mindless imitation. Thus, when failure comes, it is huge.

*****

Advice to MBA Graduates
Buffett: “Do what you enjoy the most. Work for people you admire. You can’t miss if you do that.”

*****

Highlights From 1992’s Notes

*****

It is far more fruitful to decide whether a product can sustain itself than make economic predictions.2

*****

Buffett noted that every corporate employee has to answer to someone else, except for the president. Too often the CEO also serves as chairman of the board. Given that the chairman calls the board meetings and sets the agenda, it is difficult for the board to evaluate the CEO properly. 
The central question is how do you set up a cooperative institution with an oversight board that will flash a yellow light when necessary but not so often that it disrupts operations. Buffett’s idea—one that he has publicly suggested at Salomon Brothers—is a non-executive chairman. Such a person could see to it that the CEO is properly evaluated and monitored.

*****

Buffett also noted that book value is seldom meaningful in analyzing the value of a business. Book value simply records what was put into the business. The key to calculating value is determining what will come out of the business.

*****

Highlights From 1993’s Notes

*****

True investing is really more like betting against a parimutuel system, trying to find a 2-to-1 shot that pays 3 to 1. Value investing is looking for a “mispriced gamble.”

*****

The danger of relying on historical statistics or formulas is that you end up betting on a 14-year-old horse with a great record but is now ready for the glue factory.

*****

Highlights From 1994’s Notes

*****

Asked for a follow-up, Buffett emphasized that derivatives actually serve a useful purpose. However, when ignorance is combined with borrowed money, you get interesting outcomes.

*****

Buffett gave two criteria for evaluating the performance of management: 1) How well do they run the business? and 2) How well do they treat the owners?

*****

For example, super catastrophe insurance will lose money in a given year, but over a decade, Buffett expects to make money—more money than writing something predictable. 
He said it is Wall Street nonsense to say that something that earns a lumpy 20% to 80% is “riskier” than something that earns a predictable 5% year after year.

*****

Asked about the boom in information technology, Buffett replied that his primary information source is the same as it was 40 years ago: annual reports. 
He emphasized that it is judgment that has utility in measuring price and value. What is needed is not quick information, but good information. 
Buffett concluded that if the mail and quotes were delayed three weeks, he would do just fine.3

*****

This year, Buffett cautioned that you cannot let the market think for you—“you cannot get rich with a weathervane.” 
Buffett said to beware projections (“Don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut.”) and to keep things simple (“I’d rather multiply by three than by pi.”).

*****

Highlights From 1995’s Notes

*****

Buffett added that people market these fad theories to justify needing high priests. “If all it takes is the Ten Commandments, it makes it tough on religion. ‘Listen to your customers’ as a business principle does not require a 300-page book.”

*****

While not as attractive as they were 15 years ago, Buffett noted that newspapers still have exceptionally good economics. He went so far as to say that if he could own only one business, it would probably be a newspaper in a one-newspaper town.

*****

Munger said the ideal business has a wide and long-lasting moat around a terrific castle with an honest lord. The moat represents a barrier to competition and could be low production costs, a trademark, or an advantage of scale or technology.

*****

On a general note, Buffett said, when accounting appears confusing, avoid the company. The confusion may well be intentional and reveal the character of the management.

*****

In a fascinating digression, Munger pointed out that no one has ever found a way to teach, so all are wise.

*****

quoting Bertrand Russell, “Most men would rather die than think. Many have.”

*****

Highlights From 1996’s Notes

*****

Buffett spoke highly of Gates’ managerial talent and business focus. But, ever principled, Buffett said technology is just not something they want to bet on.

*****

Buffett noted that corporate stock buybacks add to shareholder value only if the purchases are made at prices below intrinsic business value. Pay above intrinsic business value and you hurt shareholder value.

*****

“There’s not a whole lot of technology going into the art of the chew.”

*****

Munger said to think of the problem in reverse. While he could not name one business ruined by downsizing, he could think of many ruined by bloat.

*****

Buffett concluded that there is a very easy way to think like a shareholder: Become one.

*****

Accordingly, Buffett noted there are several key business risks.

*****

The first involves capital structure. A company with a ton of debt could be a candidate for foreclosure

*****

The second relates to the nature of the business and its capital requirements. With commercial airlines, for example, tons of capital is required upfront, and competition is intense.

*****

A third risk occurs with commodity businesses. Unless you’re the low-cost producer, these are poor businesses to own.

*****

Overall, Berkshire seeks low-risk businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong capital structures.

*****

If you overpay, it will take time for the business value to catch up to the price paid.

*****

filters simplify the decision-making process. Munger noted people under-rate the importance of a few big ideas.

*****

Opportunity Cost—Munger noted that for any corporate stock, a bond is an alternative. You must choose the best opportunity you can understand. He summed up, “Life is a whole series of opportunity costs.”

*****

Quality People—Buffett said he looks for a manager who bats .400 and loves it. Munger noted there are many wonderful people and many awful people. Avoid the awful. Stick to those who take their promises seriously.

*****

Buffett argued such options should have a step-up in exercise price. Otherwise, they simply become a royalty on the corporation’s buildup of retained earnings.
--
Not sure what this means 

*****

Munger noted that a billion-dollar loss would be just 2.5% of liquid assets. The real supercat risks are those borne unwittingly by insurance companies that could be wiped out by an unforeseen event.
--
Black Swan Event

*****

Munger noted that Buffett is the most rational person he has ever known and that Buffett’s ability to learn has been essential to the success of Berkshire.

*****

Munger bristled at the notion that he and Buffett are “aging executives,” exclaiming “I don’t know anybody who’s moving in the other direction!”

*****

When asked how he would teach business students, Buffett said, “For the final exam, I would take an Internet company and say ‘How much is this worth?’ And anybody that gave me an answer, I would flunk.”

*****

Buffett disclosed in Berkshire’s 1997 annual report that he had purchased $4.6 billion of long-term zero-coupon bonds as a bet on declining interest rates.

*****

As in years past, Buffett was asked what he thought about the stock market. As in years past, he said, “We don’t think about it.”

*****

The bigger the moat, the less great management is needed. As Peter Lynch has said, “Find a business any idiot could run because eventually one will.”

*****

After you have enough for daily life, all that matters is your health and those you love. Likewise in work, what really matters is that you enjoy it and the people with which you work. 
Munger concluded humorously, “What good is health? You can’t buy money with it.”

*****

The keys to analyzing Coca-Cola’s economic progress are l) unit cases sold (more is better), and 2) number of shares outstanding (the fewer the better).

*****

(Munger interjected that 10–15 year projections can tune out a lot of noise.)

*****

“if share of mind exists, the market will follow.”

*****

By learning the primary models in each major discipline (such as compound interest and probability in math and break-points and back-up systems in engineering) and applying all of them, he asserts that people will make better decisions.

*****

Insurance companies collect premiums, of which a significant portion go into reserves to pay future claims. This reserve (“float”) earns money for Berkshire, leveraging the company’s return on capital.

*****

As Munger put it, “Basically, we’re a hedgehog that knows one big thing. If you generate float at 3% per annum and buy businesses that earn 13% per annum with the proceeds of that float, we have figured out that’s a pretty good position to be in.”

*****

He compared the situation to living on an earthquake fault, building-up stress and projecting that the longer it’s been without a quake the less likely a quake is going to occur. It’s a dumb way to write earthquake insurance and a dumb way to do pension fund planning.

*****

Buffett elaborated that the power system probably should have about three elements from a societal standpoint. 
One is to be efficient. A second would be to produce a fair but not excessive return on capital to attract capital for future needs. Third, you’d want Munger’s margin of safety, an ample supply.

*****

Munger observed that the most extreme mistakes in Berkshire’s history show up as opportunity costs.

*****

In the case of sugar, Buffett noted the average human body eats something like 550 pounds in dry weight of food in a year, and about 125 pounds (over 20%) of that consists of sugar in one form or another. Yet the average life span of Americans keeps going up.
--
Wonder how true that is now

*****

Buffett asserted that the biggest money made in Wall Street in recent years has not been made by great performance, but by great promotion.

*****

He also suggested that getting knowledge about business has a similar compounding effect. 
He recommended learning about local businesses—which ones are good and why, which ones went out of business, etc. As you go, you’ll build a database in your mind that is going to pay off over time.

*****

one key element of a wonderful business: the cost structure. A superior cost structure is often fundamental to a business’ sustainable advantage.

*****

In retail, the big cost is rent, with labor being a significant secondary cost.

*****

He said he doesn’t really care whether they’re buying into raw-material-intensive businesses, people-intensive businesses or capital-intensive businesses. The key is to understand a company’s costs and why it’s got a sustainable edge against its competitors.

*****

Imagine a genie comes to a 17 year old and offers to get him any car he wants. However, there is one catch—whatever car he chooses he must make it last a lifetime. Well, you can imagine that the young man would read the owner’s manual 10 times, would change the oil twice as often as suggested, etc. to help that car last 50 years.
In the same way, Buffett continued, we each receive one body and one mind for a lifetime. You cannot repair them at age 60. You must maintain them. 
One’s greatest asset is one’s self.

*****

Buffett chided telecom companies that talk about “cash flow” when they are spending every dime they get. It isn’t cash flow if it’s all flowing out.

*****

Buffett likened derivatives to hell: “easy to get into and tough to get out of.”

*****

Munger concluded that the fact that U.S. corporations routinely dole out hundreds of millions of dollars to CEOs is “demented and immoral.”

*****

Buffett also decried the shameless and self-interested way corporate CEOs have been lobbying against treating options as an expense.

*****

Munger noted that one of the great inventions of all time was double-entry bookkeeping by an Italian monk. 
Accounting that undoes the monk’s work is merely a tool for folly and fraud, and hurts society.

*****

Buffett suggested it is helpful to list the qualities you would want in a friend and then seek to instill those qualities in yourself.

*****

Buffett claimed that successful investing is not complicated. The Rosetta Stone of investing is to remember that a stock is part ownership in a business. That principle provides the foundation for rational investing.

*****

Read lots of annual reports. Learn accounting by reading good business articles, especially those on accounting scandals. Try to know how the numbers are put together.

*****

Buffett warned investors that management that refuses to expense options or has fanciful pension assumptions will likely take the low road on other matters as well. He cautioned, “There’s seldom one cockroach in the kitchen.”

*****

He noted that GDP is often presented as a gross number. However, he emphasized that per capita GDP is far more meaningful.

*****

If you were in a rowboat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and just whispered a really dumb insurance price, insurance brokers would be swimming to you from shore . . . with their fins showing.

*****

Buffett added that Ben Graham’s quantitative approach was easy to teach.
In contrast, Munger emphasized the qualitative. They have learned by experience that they have made more money with a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. While the qualitative insight was much harder to come by, it has proved much more valuable.

*****

They mentioned the Wall Street Journal and Fortune as favorite sources and included the usual corporate filings.

*****

Munger asserted that all intelligent people base decisions on opportunity costs. The alternative returns available should weigh on whether you make a particular investment. It is freshman economics.

*****

Suppose you are in a womb with an identical twin. You are alike in all ways. A genie appears with a proposition: “You will be born in the next 24 hours. One of you will be born in Omaha, the other in Bangladesh. You two decide. You start the bidding with how much of your estate goes back to society.”

*****

Buffett claimed that you are successful if the people you hope love you, do love you.

*****

For inflation strategies, Buffett suggested, as a first line of defense, that one increase his/her earning power. For example, if you are the best surgeon or the best plumber in town, your wages will likely be more than indexed to inflation.

*****

As a second strategy, Buffett recommended owning businesses that can price through inflation and have low capital expenditures to maintain the business.

*****

quoting Bertrand Russell, “Most men would rather die than think. Many do.”

*****

As Buffett has often taught, the intrinsic value of an asset is the cash it will earn from here to eternity, discounted back to the present. However, if your estimated growth rate is greater than your discount rate, you get a value of infinity.

*****

Munger noted the common error is not thinking through the consequences of the consequences.6

*****

Buffett mentioned the need to spend lots of time looking at companies and building your database and business understanding. 
Munger agreed that one must read a lot to be wise, but curiously noted that he has found few among those who read a lot that have the proper temperament. Most get confused by the mass of information.

*****

Buffett noted that he spends a lot of time thinking about what could go wrong in big unexpected ways. 
With low probability events, he asserted that people underestimate them if they haven’t occurred for a while and overestimate them if they occurred recently. 
He jokes, “Noah ran into that.”

*****

Through-out history, it is leverage that wipes people out.

*****

positions.7Buffett summed up with regard to financial calamities: (1) don’t let it wipe you and out, and (2) be prepared to take advantage. Berkshire is so positioned.

*****

While gold may be a refuge from a declining currency, Buffett observed that is true for any physical asset.

*****

Buffett warned that when there is trouble, everything correlates. Thus, in managing catastrophic losses, one must think through the ripple effects.

*****

He believes that a good school system is like virginity: it can be preserved but not restored.

*****

Buffett noted that loose lending has run amuck. He cited with particular interest how some lenders are counting as income interest accrued but not paid.
Munger concluded that it’s yet another case of “dumb lending assisted by corrupt accounting.” Buffett quipped, “Our auditing bill just went up.”

*****

“To measure opportunity cost, take your best available opportunity versus all other options.”

*****

The key is to buy when others are paralyzed.

*****

Buffett’s view is that the most important job of the board is to pick the right CEO.

*****

The second most important job is to prevent the CEO from overreaching, which often happens in acquisitions

*****

Fill your mind with competing ideas, and see what makes sense to you.

*****

If Buffett were teaching business school, he would make it shockingly simple. Teach 1) How to Value a Business, and 2) How to Think About Market Fluctuations—that the market is there to serve you, not influence you.” That would be it.

*****

Warrenomics 101

*****

The best protection against inflation, according to Buffett, is your own earning power.

*****

The next best thing is to own wonderful businesses, especially those that have low capital requirements.

*****

He talked about the potential of solar power as the final breakthrough. It would solve the main technical problems of humankind.

*****

Buffett noted that the analytical hurdle for buying a bond requires answering the question, “Will the company go out of business?” while buying an equity requires answering the more difficult question, “Will the company prosper?”

*****

Buffett wrote Congressman Dingell that year, suggesting that 95% of the trading in these contracts would be gambling.

*****

The problem is a moral hazard: if the undisciplined are not punished for it, then why should others be disciplined?

*****

The man says, “Would you still love me if I lost all our money?” The wife replies, “Yes, I will love you always, and I would miss you terribly.”

*****

Asked about their theory for life, Munger seized the microphone and said, “Pragmatism! Do what suits your temperament. Do what works better with experience. Do what works and keep doing it. That’s the fundamental algorithm of life—REPEAT WHAT WORKS.”

*****

“You can always tell a man to go to hell tomorrow if it’s such a good idea.”

*****

Buffett quoted the Bible, “The meek will inherit the earth,” but then noted the next question is, “Will they stay meek?” Thus, it is critical to separate the chairman and CEO positions.

*****

He also noted that his Dale Carnegie course in 1951 cost him $100, and the value was incalculable as the value of good communication skills so dramatically enhanced his life. 
So Buffett’s big point was to develop yourself. Find your passion, and improve your skills.

*****

He likes painting his own canvas and getting applause for doing well. So he seeks managers who are wired in the same way, giving them the paintbrushes and compensating them well for good performance.

*****

In addition, Berkshire managers don’t have to talk to shareholders, lawyers, reporters, etc., so they can focus on their businesses.

*****

Munger called the using up of our natural gas reserves “idiotic.” He would use up our less precious thermal coal first.

*****

“Energy independence is stupid. We want to conserve it and use the other fellow’s resources.”

*****

With regard to systemic risk, Buffett noted that his first rule is to play tomorrow. That means not going broke no matter what happens. So keep plenty in reserves, and go low on debt.3
If that is handled, then you can invest.

*****

They receive $1 million a year plus 10% of the amount by which their portfolio beats the S&P on a three-year rolling basis. To encourage teamwork, 80% of the bonus is each man’s own effort and 20% is on that of the other.

*****

“Even worse, envy is the one sin that’s no fun.”

*****

it’s a lot easier to buy things sometimes than to sell them.

*****

“Interest rates are to asset prices sort of like gravity is to the apple.” 
When there are very low interest rates, there is a not much of a gravitational pull on asset prices

*****

“Interest rates power everything in the economic universe.”

*****

Buffett pointed out that when the investment tide goes out, you will see who has been swimming naked. Adding dryly, “Those naked swimmers will call Berkshire.”

*****

“Any company that gets its customers to tattoo ads on their chests can’t be all that bad.”

*****

Munger spoke about Berkshire’s competitive advantages. In his mind, those include the ability to stay sane when others are crazy. 
Another advantage he talked about was living by a corporate governance golden rule where they treat subsidiaries like they would want to be treated. Noting how rare that was in corporate America, he noted that it attracts businesses to Berkshire.

*****

“Our competitive advantage is that we have no competitors.”

*****

There are essentially five things public corporations can do with a dollar earned: reinvest in the business, acquire other businesses or assets, pay down debt, pay dividends, and/or buy in shares. 
Deciding how much to allocate to each of these five areas ideally is driven by “opportunity cost.”

*****

Munger pointed out that the alternative to having your company right-sized is what eventually happened in Russia. He quoted the Russian worker who said, “Everyone has a job, and it all works out. They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.”

*****

Buffett chimed in that he finds it interesting when he gets asked questions about investments Berkshire owns and that people think he would want to talk them up. Either Berkshire or the investee companies may be buying more shares in the future, so why would they want the price to go up?
