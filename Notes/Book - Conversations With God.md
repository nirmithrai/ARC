03 Conversations With God: An Uncommon Dialogue, Book 1
Neale Donald Walsch

we are all led to the truth for which we are ready.

*****

The question is not to whom do I talk, but who listens?

*****

constricted by the unbelievable limitation of words.

*****

My most common form of communication is through feeling.

*****

Feeling is the language of the soul.

*****

when feelings and thoughts and experience all fail, I use words.

*****

Mine is always your Highest Thought, your Clearest Word, your Grandest Feeling. Anything less is from another source.

*****

The Highest Thought is always that thought which contains joy. The Clearest Words are those words which contain truth. The Grandest Feeling is that feeling which you call love.

*****

Joy, truth, love

*****

I cannot tell you My Truth until you stop telling Me yours.

*****

when inward experience has revealed Godself, outward observation is not necessary.

*****

You will not have that for which you ask, nor can you have anything you want. This is because your very request is a statement of lack, and your saying you want a thing only works to produce that precise experience—wanting—in your reality.

*****

The correct prayer is therefore never a prayer of supplication, but a prayer of gratitude.

*****

You cannot lie to yourself. Your mind knows the truth of your thoughts.

*****

If you believe that God is the creator and decider of all things in your life, you are mistaken.

*****

This is the grand illusion in which you have engaged: that God cares one way or the other what you do.

*****

Of course, you will always hope that they do not hurt themselves. And if they do, you will be right there to help them, heal them, allow them to feel safe again, to be happy again, to go and play again another day. But whether they choose hide and seek or pretend will not matter to you the next day, either.

*****

Every human thought, and every human action, is based in either love or fear. There is no other human motivation, and all other ideas are but derivatives of these two. They are simply different versions—different twists on the same theme.

*****

though the new theology which would replace it would truly be your salvation, you cannot accept it, because the idea of a God Who is not to be feared, Who will not judge, and Who has no cause to punish is simply too magnificent to be embraced within even your grandest notion of Who and What God is.

*****

Fear is the energy which contracts, closes down, draws in, runs, hides, hoards, harms.
Love is the energy which expands, opens up, sends out, stays, reveals, shares, heals.
--
Push and pull

*****

physicality is the only way to know experientially what you know conceptually.

*****

The Triune Truth is recognized in life’s subtle relationships by everyone dealing with such relationships. Some of your religionists have described the Triune Truth as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Some of your psychiatrists use the terms superconscious, conscious, and subconscious. Some of your spiritualists say mind, body, and spirit. Some of your scientists see energy, matter, ether. Some of your philosophers say a thing is not true for you until it is true in thought, word, and deed. When discussing time, you speak of three times only: past, present, future. Similarly, there are three moments in your perception—before, now, and after. In terms of spatial relationships, whether considering the points in the universe, or various points in your own room, you recognize here, there, and the space in between.

*****

You cannot change the outer event (for that has been created by the lot of you, and you are not grown enough in your consciousness to alter individually that which has been created collectively), so you must change the inner experience. This is the road to mastery in living.

*****

Hell is the opposite of joy. It is unfulfillment. It is knowing Who and What You Are, and failing to experience that. It is being less.

*****

Remember this axiom:
If you do not go within, you go without.

*****

sacred Law of the Universe:
Allow each soul to walk its path.

*****

A thing is only right or wrong because you say it is. A thing is not right or wrong intrinsically.

*****

But I did not choose to get hit by that truck! I did not choose to get mugged by that robber, or raped by that maniac. People could say that. There are people in the world who could say that.
You are all at root cause for the conditions which exist which create in the robber the desire, or the perceived need, to steal. You have all created the consciousness which makes rape possible. It is when you see in yourself that which caused the crime that you begin, at last, to heal the condition from which it sprang.

*****

I tell you this: There is no coincidence, and nothing happens “by accident.” Each event and adventure is called to your Self by your Self in order that you might create and experience Who You Really Are. All true Masters know this. That is why mystic Masters remain unperturbed in the face of the worst experiences of life

*****

The grandest teaching of Christ was not that you shall have everlasting life—but that you do; not that you shall have brotherhood in God, but that you do; not that you shall have whatever you request, but that you do.

*****

The First Law is that you can be, do, and have whatever you can imagine. The Second Law is that you attract what you fear.

*****

There is no coincidence in the universe—only a grand design; an incredible “snowflake.”

*****

Emotion is energy in motion. When you move energy, you create effect. If you move enough energy, you create matter. Matter is energy conglomerated. Moved around. Shoved together. If you manipulate energy long enough in a certain way, you get matter. Every Master understands this law. It is the alchemy of the universe. It is the secret of all life.

*****

Thought is pure energy. Every thought you have, have ever had, and ever will have is creative. The energy of your thought never ever dies. Ever. It leaves your being and heads out into the universe, extending forever. A thought is forever.

*****

Like energy attracts like energy—forming (to use simple words) “clumps” of energy of like kind. When enough similar “clumps” criss-cross each other—run into each other—they “stick to” each other (to use another simple term). It takes an incomprehensibly huge amount of similar energy “sticking together,” thusly, to form matter. But matter will form out of pure energy. In fact, that is the only way it can form. Once energy becomes matter, it remains matter for a very long time—unless its construction is disrupted by an opposing, or dissimilar, form of energy. This dissimilar energy, acting upon matter, actually dismembers the matter, releasing the raw energy of which it was composed.

*****

in being the first to make a “wrong” choice, Adam and Eve produced the possibility of making any choice at all.

*****

The Laws are very simple.
Thought is creative.
Fear attracts like energy.
Love is all there is.

*****

In creating “something else”—namely, the realm of the relative—I have produced an environment in which you may choose to be God, rather than simply be told that you are God; in which you may experience Godhead as an act of creation, rather than a conceptualization; in which the little candle in the sun—the littlest soul—can know itself as the light.
--
Ok. I am God, now what? What will i accomplish with this? What do I want to do? Do I have to worry about the specifics? Or am I just dreaming things into being? Nvm that's a human way to think about it. Maybe I can use my power to summon a --help

*****

Fear is the other end of love. It is the primal polarity. In creating the realm of the relative, I first created the opposite of My Self. Now, in the realm in which you live on the physical plane, there are only two places of being: fear and love. Thoughts rooted in fear will produce one kind of manifestation on the physical plane. Thoughts rooted in love will produce another.

*****

Masters are those who have chosen only love. In every instance. In every moment. In every circumstance.

*****

So go ahead now. Ask Me anything.
--
Are you happy?

*****

You may ask a question, then put this book down. But watch. Listen. The words to the next song you hear. The information in the next article you read. The story line of the next movie you watch. The chance utterance of the next person you meet. Or the whisper of the next river, the next ocean, the next breeze that caresses your ear—all these devices are Mine; all these avenues are open to Me. I will speak to you if you will listen. I will come to you if you will invite Me. I will show you then that I have always been there. All ways.

*****

It has been said that if you don’t see God in the profane and the profound, you’re missing half the story. That is a great Truth.

*****

I do not love “good” more than I love “bad.” Hitler went to heaven. When you understand this, you will understand God.

*****

Your ideas about right and wrong are just that—ideas. They are the thoughts which form the shape and create the substance of Who You Are. There would be only one reason to change any of these; only one purpose in making an alteration: if you are not happy with Who You Are.

*****

If there were such a thing as sin, this would be it: to allow yourself to become what you are because of the experience of others.

*****

No, my children, please let Me assure you again, through this writing, that I am without needs. I require nothing.
This does not mean I am without desires.

*****

I desire first to know and experience Myself, in all My glory—to know Who I Am

*****

Second, I desire that you shall know and experience Who You Really Are,

*****

Third, I desire for the whole life process to be an experience of constant joy, continuous creation, never-ending expansion, and total fulfillment in each moment of now.

*****

totally joyful, loving, accepting, blessing, and grateful.
These are the Five Attitudes of God,

*****

Of course God can speak, if God wants to. It just doesn’t seem probable that God would want to speak to me.
 This is the root of every problem you experience in your life—for you do not consider yourself worthy enough to be spoken to by God.

*****

Just list the questions. Just start somewhere. Go ahead, right now. Make a list of the questions that occur to you.
--
Make a list, schedule it

*****

When will my life finally take off? What does it take to “get it together,” and achieve even a modicum of success? Can the struggle ever end?
--
Maaaaaan... I guess everyone who looks for God, has a similar reason to do so. So it makes sense that this is the first question 

*****

why are all fun things either “immoral, illegal, or fattening”?

*****

Your soul (subconscious, id, spirit, past, etc.) is the sum total of every feeling you’ve ever had (created).

*****

Thought is the first level of creation.

*****

Words are the second level of creation.

*****

Next comes action

*****

Actions are words moving. Words are thoughts expressed. Thoughts are ideas formed. Ideas are energies come together. Energies are forces released. Forces are elements existent. Elements are particles of God, portions of All, the stuff of everything.

*****

The beginning is God. The end is action. Action is God creating—or God experienced.

*****

Life will “take off” for you, then, when you choose for it to. You have not so chosen as yet. You have procrastinated, prolonged, protracted, protested. Now it is time that you promulgated and produced what you have been promised. To do this, you must believe the promise, and live it. You must live the promise of God.
 The promise of God is that you are His son. Her offspring. Its likeness. His equal.

*****

all you see in your world is the outcome of your idea about it.

*****

Do you want your life to truly “take off”? Then change your idea about it. About you. Think, speak, and act as the God You Are.

*****

Co first to your Highest Thought about yourself. Imagine the you that you would be if you lived that thought every day. Imagine what you would think, do, and say, and how you would respond to what others do and say.
--
What does "highest thought about yourself" mean?

*****

Now, having seen the differences between where you are and where you want to be, begin to change—consciously change—your thoughts, words, and actions to match your grandest vision.
This will require tremendous mental and physical effort. It will entail constant, moment-to-moment monitoring of your every thought, word, and deed. It will involve continued choice-making—consciously. This whole process is a massive move to consciousness.

*****

This is a call to stop such unconscious living. It is a challenge to which your soul has called you from the beginning of time.

*****

Begin at once to imagine it the way you want it to be—and move into that. Check every thought, word, and action that does not fall into harmony with that. Move away from those.

*****

For the soul to experience its grandeur, it must know what grandeur is. This it cannot do if there is nothing but grandeur. And so the soul realizes that grandeur only exists in the space of that which is not grand. The soul, therefore, never condemns that which is not grand, but blesses—seeing in it a part of itself which must exist for another part of itself to manifest.

*****

The job of the soul, of course, is to cause us to choose the grandeur—to select the best of Who You Are—without condemning that which you do not select.
This is a big task, taking many lifetimes, for you are wont to rush to judgment, to call a thing “wrong” or “bad” or “not enough,” rather than to bless what you do not choose.
--
Everything I'm not, made me everything i am

*****

You seem to be saying, for instance, that we should love the “wrong” so that we can know the “right.” Are you saying we must embrace the devil, so to speak?
How else do you heal him?

*****

All attack is a call for help.

*****

That which you think of, but thereafter never speak of, creates at one level. That which you think of and speak of creates at another level. That which you think, speak, and do becomes made manifest in your reality.

*****

To think, speak, and do something which you do not truly believe is impossible. Therefore, the process of creation must include belief, or knowing. This is absolute faith. This is beyond hoping. This is knowing of a certainty

*****

This place of knowing is a place of intense and incredible gratitude. It is a thankfulness in advance.

*****

All Masters know in advance that the deed has been done.

*****

Whatever it is that is now presenting itself as part of your creation, own it, claim it, bless it, be thankful for it.

*****

If there is some aspect of creation you find you do not enjoy, bless it and simply change it. Choose again. Call forth a new reality. Think a new thought. Say a new word. Do a new thing.

*****

You get your life to “take off” by first becoming very clear in your thinking about it. Think about what you want to be, do, and have. Think about it often until you are very clear about this. Then,  when you are very clear, think about nothing else. Imagine no other possibilities.

*****

Throw all negative thoughts out of your mental constructions. Lose all pessimism. Release all doubts. Reject all fears. Discipline your mind to hold fast to the original creative thought.

*****

When your thoughts are clear and steadfast, begin to speak them as truths. Say them out loud. Use the great command that calls forth creative power: I am. Make I-am statements to others. “I am” is the strongest creative statement in the universe. Whatever you think, whatever you say, after the words “I am” sets into motion those experiences, calls them forth, brings them to you.
--
But isn't "I" statements a statement from the ego? Meditative practices all aim for a dissolution of ego. How to reconcile this?
I suppose to choose an "I AM", the current "I am" of the ego must be dissolved first. Only then can you truly choose it. 

*****

The first step is learning to monitor your thoughts; to think about what you are thinking about.

*****

When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts—thoughts that negate your highest idea about a thing—think again!

*****

You can train yourself to do this. (Look how well you’ve trained yourself not to do it!)

*****

In order to truly know God, you have to be out of your mind.

*****

I am neither a king nor a ruler. I am simply—and awesomely—the Creator. Yet the Creator does not rule, but merely creates, creates—and keeps on creating.

*****

And the Word of God was not a commandment, but a covenant. These, then, are the…
TEN COMMITMENTS
You shall know that you have taken the path to God, and you shall know that you have found God, for there will be these signs, these indications, these changes in you:

*****

The irony is that most people think they have to leave where they are to get to where they want to be. And so they leave heaven in order to get to heaven—and go through hell.

*****

Enlightenment is understanding that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody you have to be except exactly who you’re being right now.

*****

You cannot—have not found a way yet to—experience what you do not know, and you do not know what you have not experienced.

*****

What Enlightenment asks you to do is to know something you have not experienced and thus experience it. Knowing opens the door to experience—and you imagine it is the other way around.

*****

Yet renunciation in the classic sense of self-denial is not required.
A true Master does not “give up” something. A true Master simply sets it aside, as he would do with anything for which he no longer has any use.

*****

There are those who say you must overcome your desires. I say you must simply change them. The first practice feels like a rigorous discipline, the second, a joyful exercise.

*****

There are those who say that to know God you must overcome all earthly passions. Yet to understand and accept them is enough. What you resist persists. What you look at disappears.

*****

To live your life without expectation—without the need for specific results—that is freedom.

*****

My joy is in the creating, not in the aftermath. Renunciation is not a decision to deny action. Renunciation is a decision to deny a need for a particular result.

*****

Now it is one thing to be love—and quite another thing to do something loving. The soul longs to do something about what it is, in order that it might know itself in its own experience. So it will seek to realize its highest idea through action.

*****

You cannot move away from something, because it will chase you all over hell and back. Therefore resist not temptation—but simply turn from it. Turn toward Me and away from anything unlike Me.

*****

The point of life is not to get anywhere—it is to notice that you are, and have always been, already there. You are, always and forever, in the moment of pure creation. The point of life is therefore to create—who and what you are, and then to experience that.

*****

You see, suffering has nothing to do with events, but with one’s reaction to them.
What’s happening is merely what’s happening. How you feel about it is another matter.

*****

The students in the school of Mastery suffer in silence because they understand that suffering is not the way of God, but rather a sure sign that there is still something to learn of the way of God, still something to remember.

*****

A practicing Master does not speak of suffering simply because a Master practicing clearly understands the power of the Word—and so chooses to simply not say a word about it.

*****

You would rather see a man dying without a whimper on the battlefield than a woman making love with a whimper in the street.

*****

“being at the spiritual game” means dedicating your whole mind, your whole body, your whole soul to the process of creating Self in the image and likeness of God.

*****

This is a day-to-day, hour-to-hour, moment-to-moment act of supreme consciousness. It is a choosing and a re-choosing every instant. It is ongoing creation. Conscious creation. Creation with a purpose. It is using the tools of creation we have discussed, and using them with awareness and sublime intention.

*****

how long you have been engaged in it is not important. Are you engaged in it now? That’s all that matters.

*****

My pay—the payoff you get when you “work for” Me—provides a great deal more than spiritual comfort. Physical comfort, too, can be yours. Yet the ironic part about all this is that, once you experience the kind of spiritual comfort My payoff provides, the last thing you’ll find yourself worrying about is physical comfort.

*****

Your job is to render them independent; to teach them as quickly and completely as possible how to get along without you. For you are no blessing to them so long as they need you to survive, but bless them truly only in the moment they realize you are unnecessary.

*****

God’s greatest moment is the moment you realize you need no God.
--
Am I starting to "need" God? I don't think so. I think I'm just letting things go and letting God handle it instead of worrying about it for no reason. Knowing that he'll protect me and my family and friends regardless of my feeling about Him

*****

A true Master is not the one with the most students, but one who creates the most Masters.

*****

And a true God is not One with the most servants, but One who serves the most, thereby making Gods of all others.
For this is both the goal and the glory of God: that His subjects shall be no more, and that all shall know God not as the unattainable, but as the unavoidable.

*****

So now, as parents, spouses, and loved ones, seek not to make of your love a glue that binds, but rather a magnet that first attracts, then turns around and repels, lest those who are attracted begin to believe they must stick to you to survive.

*****

My law is the law of cause and effect, not the law of We’ll See. There is nothing you can’t have if you choose it.

*****

You always get what you create, and you are always creating.

*****

I feel chagrined. Chastised. Embarrassed.
Does that serve you? Why not simply acknowledge the truth when you hear it, and move toward it? There is no need to recriminate against yourself

*****

Yet the purpose of relationship is not to have another who might complete you; but to have another with whom you might share your completeness.

*****

This losing of the Self in a relationship is what causes most of the bitterness in such couplings.

*****

It is not in the action of another, but in your re-action, that your salvation will be found.

*****

let all those who have ears to hear, listen. For I tell you this: at the critical juncture in all human relationships, there is only one question:
What would love do now?
No other question is relevant, no other question is meaningful, no other question has any importance to your soul.

*****

the highest choice is that which produces the highest good for you.

*****

when the absolute highest choice is made, the mystery dissolves, the circle completes itself, and the highest good for you becomes the highest good for another.

*****

For even an abuser is abused when his abuse is allowed to continue.

*****

Life may more than once call upon you to prove Who You Are by demonstrating an aspect of Who You Are Not.

*****

The biggest evil would therefore be to declare nothing evil at all.

*****

Choosing to be God-like does not mean you choose to be a martyr. And it certainly does not mean you choose to be a victim.

*****

me—what promises should I make in relationship; what agreements must I keep? What obligations do relationships carry? What guidelines should I seek?
The answer is the answer you cannot hear—for it leaves you without guidelines and renders null and void every agreement in the moment you make it. The answer is: you have no obligation. Neither in relationship, nor in all of life.
No obligation?
No obligation. Nor any restriction or limitation, nor any guidelines or rules. Nor are you bound by any circumstances or situations, nor constrained by any Code or law. Nor are you punishable for any offense, nor capable of any—for there is no such thing as being “offensive” in the eyes of God.

*****

Never do anything in relationship out of a sense of obligation. Do whatever you do out of a sense of the glorious opportunity your relationship affords you to decide, and to be, Who You Really Are.

*****

You make it sound as if holding onto a relationship means it’s been a success. Try not to confuse longevity with a job well done.

*****

long-term relationships do hold remarkable opportunities for mutual growth, mutual expression, and mutual fulfillment—and that has its own reward.

*****

Be sure you and your mate agree on purpose.
If you both agree at a conscious level that the purpose of your relationship is to create an opportunity, not an obligation—an opportunity for growth, for full Self expression, for lifting your lives to their highest potential, for healing every false thought or small idea you ever had about you, and for ultimate reunion with God through the communion of your two souls—if you take that vow instead of the vows you’ve been taking—the relationship has begun on a very good note. It’s gotten off on the right foot. That’s a very good beginning

*****

Still, it’s no guarantee of success.
If you want guarantees in life, then you don’t want life. You want rehearsals for a script that’s already been written.
Life by its nature cannot have guarantees, or its whole purpose is thwarted.

*****

You will never disserve your relationship—nor anyone—by seeing more in another than they are showing you. For there is more there. Much more. It is only their fear that stops them from showing you. If others notice that you see them as more, they will feel safe to show you what you obviously already see.

*****

people tend to see in themselves what we see in them. The grander our vision, the grander their willingness to access and display the part of them we have shown them.

*****

The work of the soul is to wake yourself up. The work of God is to wake everybody else up.
We do this by seeing others as Who They Are—by reminding them of Who They Are.
This you can do in two ways—by reminding them of Who They Are (very difficult, because they will not believe you), and by remembering Who You Are (much easier, because you do not need their belief, only your own). Demonstrating this constantly ultimately reminds others of Who They Are, for they will see themselves in you.

*****

Thinking is hard. Making value judgments is difficult. It places you at pure creation, because there are so many times you II have to say, “I don’t know. I just don’t know.” Yet still you’ll have to decide. And so you’ll have to choose. You’ll have to make an arbitrary choice.
--
Haha. Very funny

*****

Such a choice—a decision coming from no previous personal knowledge—is called pure creation. And the individual is aware, deeply aware, that in the making of such decisions is the Self created.

*****

Embarrassment is the response of a person who still has an ego investment in how others see him. Invite yourself to move past that. Try a new response. Try laughter.

*****

I mean, if a thing is judged very “good” by you, you value it less in terms of money. So the “better” something is (i.e., the more worthwhile), the less money it’s worth.
You are not alone in this. Your whole society believes this. So your teachers make a pittance and your stripteasers, a fortune. Your leaders make so little compared to sports figures that they feel they have to steal to make up the difference. Your priests and your rabbis live on bread and water while you throw coins at entertainers.

*****

Do the deed that you want to have the new thought about. Then say the words that you want to have your new thought about. Do this often enough and you’ll train the mind to think a new way.

*****

it.So act quickly when the opportunity arises, and, if you do this often enough, your mind will soon get the idea. It will be your new thought.

*****

Doing is a function of the body. Being is a function of the soul. The body is always doing something. Every minute of every day it’s up to something. It never stops, it never rests, it’s constantly doing something.
It’s either doing what it’s doing at the behest of the soul—or in spite of the soul.

*****

Your soul doesn’t care what you do for a living—and when your life is over, neither will you. Your soul cares only about what you’re being while you’re doing whatever you’re doing

*****

Beingness attracts beingness, and produces experience.
 You are not on this planet to produce anything with your body. You are on this planet to produce something with your soul. Your body is simply and merely the tool of your soul. Your mind is the power that makes the body go. So what you have here is a power tool, used in the creation of the soul’s desire.
--
So why does my body refuse the things I want to do? Why does my mind refuse my goals? What am I doing wrong?

*****

Yet the body and the mind together do not have to do anything to control the soul—for the soul is completely without need (unlike the body and the mind, which are shackled with it), and so allows the body and the mind to have their way all the time.
Indeed, the soul would have it no other way—for if the entity which is you is to create, and thus know, who it really is, it must be through an act of conscious volition, not an act of unconscious obedience.
 Obedience is not creation, and thus can never produce salvation.

*****

The function of the soul is to indicate its desire, not impose it.
The function of the mind is to choose from its alternatives.
The function of the body is to act out that choice.
When body, mind, and soul create together, in harmony and in unity, God is made flesh.

*****

It is true that when you achieve certain states of being over a long period of time, success in what you are doing in the world is very difficult to avoid. Yet you are not to worry about “making a living.” True Masters are those who have chosen to make a life, rather than a living.

*****

Think of it this way. The word “I” is the key that starts the engine of creation. The words “I am” are extremely powerful. They are statements to the universe. Commands.
Now, whatever follows the word “I” (which calls forth the Great I Am) tends to manifest in physical reality.
Therefore “I” + “want success” produces you wanting success. “I” + “want money” must produce you wanting money.

*****

You’re welcome. But, if you repeat a thought, or say a word, over and over again—not once, not twice, but dozens, hundreds, thousands of times—do you have any idea of the creative power of that?
A thought or a word expressed and expressed and expressed becomes just that—expressed. That is, pushed out. It becomes outwardly realized. It becomes your physical reality.

*****

Affirmations do not work if they are merely statements of what you want to be true. Affirmations work only when they are statements of something you already know to be true

*****

The mind abandons the body, and all matters of the body. Everything is ignored. Relationships are set aside. Families are disappeared. Jobs are made secondary. Bills go unpaid. The body itself is not even fed for long periods. The entire focus and attention of the entity are now on the soul, and matters of the soul.
This can lead to a major personal crisis in the day-to-day life of the being, although the mind perceives no trauma. It is hanging out in bliss.

*****

I created all of this—all of this—in the blink of an eye; in one holy instant—just as the creationists have said. And…it came about through a process of evolution taking billions and billions of what you call years, just as the evolutionists claim.

*****

I am giving you ever-so-small a glimpse of infinity—and infinite love.

Monad? I had a feeling this book was closer to hermeticism/gnosticism
