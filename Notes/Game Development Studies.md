# ABANDONED
takes too long. gives illusion of progress without any results. best to just do a practical project instead

# Goal
To learn from the best and see what a finished project looks like. 
- Best practices, 
- APIs, 
- modularity, 
- interoperability, 
- project structure
- communications across codebases

## Misc topics to study
POT file in relation to localization. what is it? how do you use it in godot? Poedit software


# How to study
**Look for**
Start with a list of things to look for in a project. Update as you explore the project

**Read the docs**
its good to know what the project is trying to achieve

**Note it down**
If you find something interesting, note it down

**Map the Architecture**
- Autoloads
- Resources
- Signals
- Scenes
- Classes
- Scripts
doesn't have to be all of them, pick which ones are worth it





this comes from [[I want to learn to write good gdscript code. Can you find me examples of good modular projects (games or plugins) that I can look at and study]]
