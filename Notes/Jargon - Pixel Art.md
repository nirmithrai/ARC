# 📏 Technical Fundamentals

Canvas – The working area. Measured in pixels (e.g. 32x32, 64x64).

Pixel Perfect – Clean, sharp placement of pixels; no anti-aliasing or blurry edges.

Palette – The set of colors you're using in a piece. Often limited on purpose.

Color Ramp – A gradient of shades from dark to light within a color hue.

Indexed Color – A restricted palette where each pixel references a color index.

# 🎨 Artistic Techniques

Dithering – Checkerboard patterns used to blend two colors, simulate gradients.

Anti-aliasing (AA) – Smoothing jagged edges by manually adding intermediate colors. Not always used in pixel art.

Cluster – A group of same-colored pixels that form a recognizable shape or shadow. Clean clusters = clean art.

Banding – Unintended stair-step shadows that look unnatural. Generally avoided.

Pillow Shading – Shading directly around an object from all sides. Looks amateur—avoid it.

# ✂️ Process / Animation Terms

Sprite – A pixel art object (like a character or item). Usually animated.

Tile / Tileset – A grid-based system where repeated tiles make up a level.

Frame – A single image in an animation sequence.

Keyframe – Major pose in an animation. Used to define motion extremes.

Inbetweens / Tweens – Transitional frames between keyframes.

# 🧠 Design Concepts

Silhouette – The outline shape of your sprite. Needs to be instantly recognizable.

Readability – How clearly a sprite communicates its form and function.

Contrast – Difference in brightness or color to distinguish parts.

Hue Shifting – Tweaking hue slightly in shadows/highlights to give depth
