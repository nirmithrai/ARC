> Good artists borrow. Great Artists Steal

So do great programmers. i'm writing this now because i came across a problem while i was doing my [[Game Development Studies]].

there was a plugin called **input_helper**. it has all the features i want. so why don't i use that in my project? cool. 

but then [[Cogito - First Person Immersive Sim Template Project]]. How much of it should i use? If i use it all, i'll be a slave to the project and its workings. if i dont use any of it, i'll have to write all this bs myself. This problem will repeat itself with every single mechanic too.  So what do i do?

STEAL

i'll take it part by part. i'll make it mine so that i both understand it and be able to make it fit into a larger project.

There is nothing new under the sun. Everything is a remix. I've tried to be as original as i can be. but at some point you realize, every thought you have is influenced by and is a product of a thought someone else also had. Originality is found in hiding the inspiration. So i should be stealing more. Stealing, then covering it up so it becomes unrecognizable. 

I was planning on doing that with stories and movies and music but i should also do it with code. So now it turns from "i have to write a lot of code" to "i have to find someone who's done it already"
