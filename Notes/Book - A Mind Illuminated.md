# Introduction 

The goal is [[Awakening]]. 

  

Some terms to be familiar with. 
[[Samatha]] - tranquility
[[VIPASSANA]] - INSIGHT
[[Samadhi]] - concentration / effortlessly stable attention
[[Sati]] - powerful mindfulness

  

Samadhi and sati generates samatha and VIPASSANA which culminates into Awakening. 

  

Mindfulness and concentration puts you into a state of tranquility and generates a series of INSIGHTS. These INSIGHTS in the state of tranquility culminates into Awakening which is the climax of these insights and causes a cognitive event.

Samatha has 5 characteristics

- samadhi

- sati

- joy

- tranquility

- equanimity (being stoic in times of difficulty)

  

To achieve the complete state of samastha, we work with stable attention (samadhi) and mindfulness (sati) until joy appears. The joy will mature into tranquility and equanimity arrises out of that tranquility. 

  

The mind in the state of Samastha is an ideal instrument for developing INSIGHTS (VIPASSANA). 

  

"VIPASSANA is INSIGHT into the true nature of reality that radically transforms our understanding of ourselves and our relationship with the world"

  

(A profound realization perhaps)

  

There are more mundane insights about everyday life and problems that arise as well, but those are not VIPASSANAS. 

  

VIPASSANAS are 

- experiantial and not intellectual

- deeply intuitive realizations

- transend and shatter commonly held beliefs and understanding

  

5 most important are insights into

1. Impermanence

2. Emptiness

3. Nature of suffering

4. Casual independence of all phenomena

5. Illusion of the separate self

  

First 4 can be achieved through Samadhi and sati by investigating phenomena (dhamma vicaya). 

5th is the awakening insight that lets us understand our true self by overcoming our self centered worldview (ego death?)

For 5th to happen we need to have the previous 4 and also have achieved tranquility and equanimity (in the state of samastha)

  

You need both samadhi and sati to generate both samastha and VIPASSANA. Samadhi without sati leads to blissful dullness and sati without samadhi leads to mind wandering. They need to be cultivated together. 

  

"Awakening is an accident, but continued practice will make you accident-prone."

  

This is Śamatha-VIPASSANĀ meditation. There are 10 stages and 4 milestones. There are interludes between stages. 

  

1st interlude lays the groundwork. Explains the model of Conscious Experience. Teaches about attention and peripheral awareness. 

2nd is about the major hurdles in practice. 

3rd builds on ideas of mindfulness. 

4th Moments of Consciousness model

5th Mind-System model

6th lays foundation for Stages 7 - 10

7th refines the models

  

Either read the whole book or use it as a reference. 

  

If you're lost, re-read The Overview of the Ten Stages chapter

  

For beginners, reading the walking meditation appendix and incorporating it into daily life is recommended. 

  
  

## 10 stages of Meditation

Monk image

monk - meditator. 

rope - vigilant, alert mindfulness. 

other hand, goad - strong intentions, firm resolve. 

Elephant - mind. Blackness - 5 hinderances, 7 problems. 

Monkey - scattering of attention. Blackness - subtle.  & gross distraction, forgetting, mind-wandering. 

Rabbit - subtle dullness. 

Flames - vigilance, effort. Flames disappear when effort is no longer required. 

Road length - time between stages

Stages come closer till stage 7 then stretch out. 

"Because the road folds back, it is possible to jump up to higher Stages or fall back to lower ones."

  
  

## Tldr on the stages

1. Establish practice

2. Stop mind wandering

3. Attention 

4. Stop getting bored

5. Mindfulness

6. Subtle distractions

7. Unify mind

8. Pacify senses

9. Calm the meditative joy

10. Tranquility extends beyond the sessions

  

## The right attitude

Do not try to force your mind into submission. 

  

"intentions lead to mental actions, and repeated mental actions become mental habits."

  

(Where there is a will, there is a way. Point your will at a particular intention (a high level goal) and everything else you'll figure out on the way)

  

Don't blame yourself for failures, just focus on your intention. 

  

## Stages in terms of intentions

1. Regular practice

2. Focus on breath

3. Invoke introspective attention, correct distraction/dullness, sustain peripheral awareness

4 - 6. Vigilant introspective awareness and immediate correction of distraction/dullness

7. Guard against distraction/dullness

8 - 10. Simply keep practicing

  
  
  
  

# First Interlude: Conscious Experience and the Objectives of Meditation

Introduces a map of the landscape of the mind. A Model of Conscious Experience. 

2 major objectives of meditation practice

1. Stable attention

2. Mindfulness

  

Consciousness is what we experience in the present. 

There is a field of awareness similar to vision. 

Peripheral awareness is like peripheral vision but for all the senses combined to form a conscious experience. 

Attention is similarly like visual focus. 

  

Awareness and attention are the 2 different aspects. 

  

## 1st Objective Stable Attention - its a better term for "Concentration". 

  

"spontaneous movements of attention." Is the opposite of stable attention. 

3 ways (of what?)

- scanning. Focus moving till i finds something of interest

- getting captured. Something catches your attention

- alternating. automatic multitasking of focus. 

  

"Intentionally directed attention" - consciously deciding what to pay attention to. 

Then you "sustain attention" so that the mind doesnt wander off. Sustaining is harder because it is unconscious. The mind weighs what the most important thing to focus on is. 

We can tip the scale by holding a strong intention and returning to the breath over and over. 

  

"Exclusive attention to one object, also called single-pointedness, is very different from alternating attention. Exclusive attention doesn’t move back and forth between distractions and our intended focus"

  

"This is the very essence of meditation: we reprogram unconscious mental processes by repeating basic tasks over and over with a clear intention."

  

Scope of Attention can be narrow or wide. Wide is similar to alternating attention. Expanded scope is also easier to be distracted. 

  
  

## 2nd Objective Mindfulness - it is the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness, which requires increasing the overall conscious power of the mind.

  

"Attention analyzes our experience, and peripheral awareness provides the context."

  

Peripheral awareness is filtering everything we see so it is quicker to respond. Attention cares deeply about one object. 

  

Peripheral is more objective but attention is more personal and self centered. 

  

Metacognitive Introspective Awareness - when the mind (peripheral) checks its own overall state. Is it happy, sad, etc. 

  
  

## Cultivating Mindfulness

  

Why cultivate?

1. We dont know how to use it

2. We dont have to power to sustain it

  

"Awareness deficit disorder" chronic lack of awareness due to the over reliance on attention. 

  

Need to develop raw mental power. Both attention and awareness draw from the same pool of power so you need a bigger pool. It also increases the quality of both att&awa 

  

To increase the power of mindfulness practice attention and awareness at the same time. 

  

## How Mindfulness Progresses through the Ten Stages

Starts at

Stage 3: Practice focusing on meditation object while sustaining extrospective awareness

Stage 4 - 6: emphasis is on introspective awareness. Stage 5: trying to detect very subtle sensations without losing awareness

Stage 6: increase scope to entire body. By the end you will have "meta-cognitive introspective awareness" ie ability to observe state and activity of the mind. 

Stage 7-8: honing in on the constantly changing details of sensations. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

# Stage One: Establishing A Practice

![[Img_990_27-book_reader_ReadEra.png]]
  
The meditator begins to chase the running elephant, holding a goad in one hand and a rope in the other. These represent the vigilant, alert mindfulness (rope) and strong intention (goad) that will eventually be used to tame the elephant (the mind). The elephant is being led with a leash held by a running monkey (scattering of attention).
- The elephant is all black, meaning the mind is dominated by the Five Hindrances and the Seven Problems.
- The monkey is all black, meaning attention scatters because there is little intentional control over its movements.
- The flame indicates the effort required to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
  
Hold the intention of having a daily meditation session. If you fail, work on your motivation and intentions rather than forcing yourself to practice. 

Practice Goals for Stage 1
1. Learn to prepare for practice and enter meditation gradually
2. Establish daily practice

How to begin practice
1. Direct attention to meditation object
2. If your attention slips, redirect it to the object
3. Repeat

Its best to ease yourself to the meditation object. 

## 6 point preparation for meditation

Motivation, Goals, Expectations, Diligence, Distractions, and Posture
1. Motivation. Remind yourself why you meditate
2. Goals. What's the goal for this session? Check the stages if you're confused
3. Expectations. Don't worry about where you "should be". There is no "bad meditation"
4. Diligence. Don't indulge in tempting distractions. Just continue your practice
5. Distractions. Preemptively resolve or set aside for later things that may become distractions. 
6. Posture. Attend to your supports, your head, neck, back, shoulders, lips eyes and breath. 

## Meditation Object

Its what you choose to focus your attention on during the session. 

Breath is ideal for cultivating attention and mindfulness. 

Breath means the sensations of breathing not visualization of breath. 


## A Gradual Four-Step Transition to the Meditation Object
Its a method of gradually focusing your area of attention from the surrounding to the body to parts of body that move with the breath to the sensation of the breath in the nose. 

Awareness should not be forgotten in this. In fact the aim is to learn to distinguish between peripheral awareness and stable attention. 

Relax and try to evoke the feeling of happiness and contentment. This acts as a sort of reward for your brain to seek peaceful sensations. 

### Step 1: Focus on the Present
Open your peripheral awareness fully and let attention roam free. Focus on sensations over thoughts, this should help you be in the *present*

Don't analyze what your attention is going towards. Just accept it and move on. Disregard anything that's not present in the present. 

If it's pleasant, enjoy it. 

> let it come, let it be, let it go


### Focus on Bodily Sensations 
Once you're fully present with every kind of sensory stimulus, limit your attention to bodily sensations. 

If you start feeling restless try stepping back to step 1 and then come back. There's no hurry to get to the next step but sometimes next step can be what you need, so feel free to give that a try too. (Either go back or forward a step if you're losing focus)


### Step 3: Focus on Bodily Sensations Related to the Breath
Try to see what parts of your body are affected by the breath. 

Allow attention to move between these breath-related sensations. 

### Step 4: Focus on Sensations of the Breath at the Nose
Focus attention on the area where breath sensations are clearest. 

**Remember, the object of the meditation is the sensations of the breath not the breath itself**

The goal is to tame the constant movement of attention, while trying to maintain peripheral awareness. 

> Stable Attention + Mindfulness



## Counting as a Method to Stabilize Attention
Start counting once you reach step 4. 

Restart counting if you miss a sensation of miss a count. 

A beginner is doing well if he's aware of *most* of the breaths. 

You can talk to yourself as long as it's about the breath and as long as you don't lose count. 

Try to consider the breathing out as the start of the new cycle. 

> The rule is never more than 10, never less than 5

If you lose concentration start counting again. If you lose it for a long time, go back to step 2 briefly. 


## Summary of the Basic Practice

> Sit down, close your eyes, and go through the Six Point Preparation for Meditation: Motivation, Goals, Expectations, Diligence, Distractions, and Posture. 
> Then, do the Four-Step Transition, gradually restricting the natural movements of your attention as you move from one Step to the next. The transition needs to be gentle and gradual. Emphasize relaxation, peacefulness, and pleasure, rather than willpower and effort. 
> When you reach Step Four and you’re focusing on the breath at the nose, stabilize your attention by counting five or ten breaths without interruption. When you’re finished counting, keep attending to the sensations of the breath at the nose.


Remember, the goal of Step 1 is to establish a daily practice. ( I'm way ahead on that part :) )
