“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.”

  

Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it.

  

The most important is that the writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.

  

Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.

  

Writing is Telepathy. 

  

Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page.

  

Toolbox:

  

I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work.

  

Fazza’s toolbox had three levels. I think that yours should have at least four.

  

Common tools go on top. The commonest of all, the bread of writing, is vocabulary.

  

One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones.

  

Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.

  

You’ll also want grammar on the top shelf of your toolbox.

  

Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense.

  

The adverb is not your friend. They’re the ones that usually end in -ly.

  

On the layer beneath go those elements of style

  

Easy books contain lots of short paragraphs—including dialogue paragraphs which may only be a word or two long—and lots of white space. Hard books, ones full of ideas, narration, or description, have a stouter look. A packed look. Paragraphs are almost as important for how they look as for what they say; they are maps of intent.

  

In expository prose, paragraphs can (and should) be neat and utilitarian. The ideal expository paragraph contains a topic sentence followed by others which explain or amplify the first.

  

In fiction, the paragraph is less structured—it’s the beat instead of the actual melody. When composing it’s best not to think too much about where paragraphs begin and end; the trick is to let nature take its course. If you don’t like it later on, fix it then. That’s what rewrite is all about.

  

I would argue that the paragraph, not the sentence, is the basic unit of writing—the place where coherence begins and words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words. If the moment of quickening is to come, it comes at the level of the paragraph.

  
  

On Writing

  

If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. 

  

Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life.

  

Stories and novels consist of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech.

  

Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.

  

A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question. 

  

Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty, and best kept under house arrest.

  

Description is what makes the reader a sensory participant in the story.

  

It’s also important to know what to describe and what can be left alone while you get on with your main job, which is telling a story.

  

Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.

  

The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction—reading it and writing it, as well.

  

The most common—and again, landing in this trap can usually be traced back to not enough reading—is the use of clichéd similes, metaphors, and images.

  

The key to good description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary.

  

It’s dialogue that gives your cast their voices, and is crucial in defining their characters—only what people do tells us more about what they’re like, and talk is sneaky: what people say often conveys their character to others in ways of which they—the speakers—are completely unaware.

  

one of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show us,

  

It’s also important to remember that no one is “the bad guy” or “the best friend” or “the whore with a heart of gold” in real life; in real life we each of us regard ourselves as the main character, the protagonist, the big cheese; the camera is on us, baby.

  

You can’t please all of the readers all of the time; you can’t please even some of the readers all of the time, but you really ought to try to please at least some of the readers some of the time.

  

Two examples of the sort of work second drafts were made for are symbolism and theme.

  

Formula: 2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%.

  

The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest.

  

research is back story, and the key word in back story is back.

  

remember that you are writing a novel, not a research paper.
