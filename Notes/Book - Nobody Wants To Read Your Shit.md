1. Streamline the message

2. Make it compelling. So compelling they would be crazy not to read it

3. Apply it to all forms of writing or art or commerce. 

  

Ask yourself with every sentence and every phrase

-is this interesting?

-is it fun or challenging or inventive?

-am I giving the reader enough?

-are they following where I want to lead her?

  

# BOOK 1 ADVERTISING

  

Don't think in ads, think in campaigns. 

How big is your concept?

Ans: how many "pool-outs"(spin offs) will it spawn. 

  

Thinking in concepts. 

It's not enough to catch the reader's eyes, you have to sell the product. 

  

What is a concept?

Concept establishes a frame of reference that is greater than the product itself. 

Concept makes the viewer view the product in a new light. 

  

What is a high concept movie?

1. Film whose narrative idea can be communicated in 10s or less. 

2. As soon as you hear the idea, you can imagine all the cool scenes it might have. 

  

Steal without shame. 

"It ain't stealing if you put a spin on it"

  

You have bad ideas when...

...you try too hard

...you work mechanically

...you follow formula

...you're desperate or panicky

  

Problems and solutions

The solution is embedded in the problem. 

To find the solution, define the problem, you'll be halfway to the solution. 

  

Defining the problem in fiction. 

What's the theme?

  

Art is artifice 

  

It's okay not to be 100% pure

  
  

# BOOK 2 FICTION PART 1

  

A novice fades near the finish line. 

  

Find your demon. Either you slay it or it will slay you. 

  

A real writer has something to give. 

  
  

# BOOK 3 HOLLYWOOD

  

A movie script is composed of 3 acts. 

  

A single principle that is indispensable to structuring any kind of narrative:

Break the piece into 3 parts - beginning, middle and end

  

Act 1 - Hook the audience

Act 2 - building the tension and complications

Act 3 - pay it all off

  

That's how a joke is told. Setup, progression, punch line. 

That's how a story is told. 

That's how you seduce someone. Hook, build, payoff

  

The David Lean rule:

"Every work can be divided into 8-12 major sequences"

This is alternative to 3 act structure. Because TV and novels are different to movies. 

  

Movies are about genre. 

Why is genre so important?

Because every film, novel, play falls into a genre, and every genre has its own ironclad, unbreakable rules.

The hero's journey.

1. Hero starts in ordinary world

2. Hero receives call to adventure

3. Hero rejects call

4. Hero meets mentor. Mentor gives courage to accept call

5. Hero crosses threshold, enters special world

6. Hero encounters enemies and allies, undergoes ordeal that will serve as his initiation

7. Hero confronts villain, acquires treasure

8. The road back. Hero escapes special world, trying to get home

9. Villain pursue hero. Hero must fight/escape again

10. Hero returns home with treasure, reintegrates into Ordinary world, but now as a changed person, thanks to his ordeal and experiences on his journey. 

  

Three-Act structure + Hero's Journey = Story

Symbols of Transformation

  

A story is experienced by the reader on the level of the soul. And the soul had a universal structure of narrative receptors. 

  

Every genre is a version of the hero's journey

  

Every story has to be about something. A single idea how the work together and makes it cohere. 

  

Every first act must have an inciting incident. 

Inciting incident is the event that makes the story start. 

Embedded in the inciting incident is the climax. 

  

The second act belongs to the villain. The scarier the monster, the deeper the jeopardy, and the deeper the jeopardy, the more emotion will be produced in the hearts of the audience. 

  

Every character must represent something greater than himself. Every character stands for some quality, some aspect of the story's theme that transcends his narrow significance as an individual. 

Every critical prop, artifact, or article of clothing can and should represent something significant to the theme and the story. 

  

Movies are pictures. 

"Keep it primal"

A great movie should be so basic, so soul-grounded, that it could be understood by a caveman, ie without language, without dialogue. 

  

Start at the end. 

  

Even in non-fiction, Stories work. Tell it as a story. 

  

Stakes. 

"Have a body hit a floor". 

Stakes should be as high as possible. 

High stakes=high emotional involvement by the audience. 

  

Jeopardy. 

Get your characters in danger as quickly as possible and keep ratcheting up that jeopardy throughout the story. 

The more jeopardy to your characters, the more the audience will care and more involved they will become. 

  

Jeopardy and stakes are twin sides of the same coin. 

  

"Thou shalt not take the climax out of the hands of the protagonist"

  

The audience want to see a star

What makes a role for a star?

1. His and nobody else's issues drive the story. 

2. His desire is monumental. The stakes for him are life and death. 

3. His passion for this desire is unquenchable. He will pursue it to the gates of hell. 

4. Art the critical points in the story, his actions/needs dictate the way the story turns. 

5. The story ends when his issues are resolved and no sooner. 

  

The character must undergo a radical change from the start of the film to the finish. He has to have an arc. He must evolve. 

  

How do we write for a star?

We establish a theme that is worthy of a star. 

  

Don't be afraid to make your hero suffer. 

Suffering is drama. 

  

Give the star an inner and outer journey. 

  

A star wants to be unforgettable. 

  

Does a protagonist have a star arc?

Have we given her start scenes?

Does she suffer like a Star?

Evolve like a Star?

Is she one of A kind?

Is she unforgettable?

  

The all is lost moment. 

The darker the hero's midnight hour, the more powerful will be their triumph and the more emotional will be the audience's identification and involvement with him. 

  

The all is lost moment is followed almost immediately by a breakthrough epiphany, an "aha!" Moment. 

From this point it's a pedal to the metal rush into act 3 and the story's climax begins. 

The moment not only defines the stake and the jeopardy for the protagonist and for the Audience, but it restates the themes and answers the question, "What is this story about?"

  

Give your villain a brilliant speech. 

It must accomplish at least 2 things. 

1. Allow the antagonist to state his point of view clearly and powerfully. 

2. It must be stated so rationally and compelling in its logic that the audience low key agree with it. 

Why? Because greater and more interesting the villain, the greater and more interesting the hero and more satisfying his or her triumph over the foe. 

  

Keep the villain human. 

  
  

# BOOK 4 FICTION: THE SECOND TIME

  

Story telling skills

1. Every work must have a theme. It should be about something

2. Every work must have a concept, ie a twist or slant or framing device

3. Every work must start with the inciting incident

4. Every work must be divided into 3 acts or 7/8/9 David Lean Sequences

5. Every character must represent something greater than themselves

6. The protagonist embodies the theme

7. The antagonist personifies the counter-theme

8. The protagonist and antagonist clash in the climax around the issue of the theme

9. The climax resolves the clash

  

Fiction is truth

  

Nonfiction is fiction

Write nonfiction as if it were fiction, ie

-give it 3 acts

-make it cohere around a theme

-give it a hero

-give it a villian 

-make narrative build to a climax

-have climax resolve the conflict in the theme

  

Narrative device

It asks 4 questions

1. Who tells the story?

2. How do they tell it? (Real time, letters, etc)

3. What tone does the narrator employ?

4. To whom is the story  told?

Narrative device must work on theme. 

  
  

Novels are about the long game

Novels are about immersion

  
  

Dueling the Monster that is a novel

  

Think in blocks of time

The enemy in in an endurance Enterprise is not itme, it's resistance

  

Think in multiple drafts

"Top Gun" Epps rule: You can't fix everything in one draft. 

  

Surrender to the material

A novel is too big to contain the whole thing in our mind, to see it in one piece

The material "wants" to be something, and it is our job to discover what that is and to help it help it become that. 

  

Master the material. 

You have to render it fit for human consumption

  
  

Flashbacks:

Screenplay writer knows the importance of structure. He starts at the end and writes the rest to make the climax land with the necessary impact. 

  

We cannot give our readers ores. We have to give them gold.

  

A great concept gives every word and every scene an interesting, illuminating spin. 

  

Theme is what the story is about. 

  

Concept is external. It frames the material and makes us look at every element from a specific point of view. 

Theme is internal. When you take out the plot, the characters and dialogue all that remains is the theme. 

  

Example: Supranos

Concept: Let's take a gangster and send him to a shrink. Whenever he whacks somebody, he feels guilty about it. We'll show a crime boss suffering internally. 

Theme: All of us are crazy in the same way. A gangster's inner turmoil is the same as every other affluent suburbanite with a family and a job. The only difference is our protagonist regularly kills people. 

  
  

# BOOK 5 NONFICTION

There is nothing about any of the principles of story that cannot be applied to nonfiction. 

  

Universal structural elements of all stories

Hook, build, payoff also works for nonfiction

  
  

Applying Story telling principles to nonfiction. 

  

Start with the theme. This is the toughest and most important part of the whole project. 

  

Make our hero embody the theme. 

  

Cut everything that is not on-theme

What you keep, make all of it work on theme

  

Identify the climax

  

Solve the climax structurally

If a moment is too important to skip over use structural techniques to bring it back at the end. 

  

# BOOK 6 SELF-HELP

  

Voice of authority is critical in self-help. 

How can a voice establish authority?

1. Pre-loaded by reputation in their field

2. Backing of extensive academic research

3. Citing their academic or professional credentials

4. Record of sales or success

5. By their presence in media/online media

6. Hardest but best way, is through the quality and integrity of the voice itself. 

  

Narrative device is supremely important in a self help. 

  

# BOOK 7 THE ARTIST'S CALLING

  

How Career happens:

  

There is a devil

  

There is a Muse

As powerful as is the negative, destructive force we name Resistance, so mighty is the positive, creative force we call the Muse. 

  

The artist's world is mental

  

The artist's skill: the artist enters the Void with nothing and comes back with something

  

The white whale

If you have a million ideas, how do you know which one to work on?

Ans: write your white whale

  

Which idea are you compelled to pursue the way Ahab was driven to hunt Moby Dick?

Here's how you know - you're scared to death of it. 

You should be scared. Mediocre ideas don't elevate the heart rate. 

  

The whale is your unwritten book, your unsung song, your calling as an artist. You die grappling with this thing, lashed to it, battling it even as it takes you under. But your death is not a mortal death. You die instead, the artist's death, which leads to resurrection in a higher nobler form and recruits you to the next hunt, the next chase, the pursuit of the next Thing You Love. 

It's accomplishment will seem beyond your resources. Your pursuit will bear you into waters where no one before you has sailed. To hunt this beast will require everything you've got. 

  

# BOOK 8 PORN

  

"Make the screwing advance the story"

  

"Never write me a sec scene where nothing happens but the sex. Always have something else going on at the same time."
