Feeling inspired by Don't Tap the Glass by Tyler.

It's crazy that I never actually articulated what my dream game is. This is what should be fueling my motivation for [[Game Development]]. 

So let's put my thoughts down. 

A living world. Great music. Great story. Great art style. Great cutscenes. A sense of mystery. 

Just walking around the world talking to people should be engaging enough. A talking simulator at its core. Must not be boring 
[[Nature of Boredom]]

Player created characters with job systems. A detective, a musician, a journalist, a politician, a construction worker ([[Motor Town]]) etc. and handmade characters 

Dialogue generation engine. [[Morrowind]] + localLLM. Classify every human archetype and every emotion. Behavioral engine that simulates consequences for actions. NPCs drive the conversation while giving you the freedom to talk. 

1 world. Great Geography. Everything else built on top of it based on how the civilization progresses. How do different factions interact with each other? How do they change the landscape? How do they affect the geopolitics? How does being part of a faction/nation affect npc psychology? The exceptions are always interesting. 

Infinite like the mandelbrot set. 

As efficient as possible. No wasted byte.

Great graphics. Art style > fidelity but still uses every graphics tricks in the book. Excellent performance. Optimised to hell and back. 

A perfect codebase. Everything clean. Maintainance heaven. Extremely extendable and modifiable. Great self-documentation and perfect variable naming. 

Amazing side characters. Memorable and lovable. 

Dynamic cinematic cutscenes. No talking head back and forth. 

A perfect blend of hand crafted and generated content. 

Game developer's dream. South park level of quick turnaround from idea to execution for quests and storylines.
