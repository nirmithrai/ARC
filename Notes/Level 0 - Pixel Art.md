Level 0 is for understanding the interest.

# What it is?
An art style that's drawn at a pixel level 

# What kind of interest is it?
Action? Learning? 
Action based. I know the basic theory, but need deliberate practice.

# Why is it of interest to me?
For creating game assets. Useful for 2D games of course, but also for creating 3D textures in low poly models.

# Do's and Don'ts?
- use a colour palette 
- zoom out every now and then
- cluster > single pixels
- consistent light direction 
- don't use techniques as a checkbox
- not everything needs anti aliasing
- key frames come first
- don't assume tiling will loop perfectly as it is, check 
- png > jpg
- don't polish one sprite forever. Ship it and move on.
