5 reasons we read slowly

1. Regression. Looking backwards. Soln: eyes always moving forward

2. Subvocalization. Soln: see the words visually, not hear them

3. Small fixations. Not using peripheral vision. Soln: take bigger word chunks

4. Time between fixations. Soln: process fixations more quickly

5. Lack of focus. Soln: read uninterrupted

  

2 things for speed reading
