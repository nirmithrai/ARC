[[Different types of Notes]]

## The Workflow
1.  When reading a book take Literature Notes. If you have any ideas use fleeting notes to take them down as well. 
2.  At the end of the day convert those notes into Permanent Main Notes. These will go into the Slip Box. 
3.  As you add more main notes, make sure to keep in mind the existing notes in the box. This was you will cross pollinate the ideas and gain insights when you see a new idea in a different context. [[What Makes a Good Zettle]]
4.  Arrange these notes in terms of how close it is related to existing note in the system. Make sure it links to other notes. [[Writing as Thinking]]
5.  For Projects collect all the relevant notes, rearrange them according to your need and then flesh it out while writing your draft. [[Turning Notes into Products]]
6.  Publish!
