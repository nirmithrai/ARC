Level 0 is for understanding the interest.

# What it is?
 A person who is interested in a variety of fields.

# What kind of interest is it?
Action? Learning? 
It contains both, but it is the action part that I need to do to set it up.

# Why is it of interest to me?
I have a lot of interests and I want to pursue them all at my own pace without forcing myself to stick to one.

# Jargon
**Interest** - a skill I want learn, or a project I want to do, or a topic I want to study 

**Topic** - a catch all term for any part of the interest that has its own page. 

**Level** - a step towards the end goal. At the end of each level I'll have an "Exam".

**Exam** - a set of tasks that I have to perform to prove to myself that I'm ready to move on to the next level. This is to avoid 2 problems 
1. Getting stuck at the same level doing the thing I already know
2. Getting too excited and jumping to the next level without fully understanding the current level
