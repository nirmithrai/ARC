- Writing is permanent. It has to stand on its own two feet against the world's criticism. 
- Writing dispels the foggy, overconfident notion of abundance of knowledge and forces you to face the reality of what you actually know.
- Writing changes you from being a consumer to being a producer.
- Will help differentiate between good *sounding* argument and *actually* good arguments 

Always know why you're writing, only then can you write **deliberately** [[Deliberate Practice]]
