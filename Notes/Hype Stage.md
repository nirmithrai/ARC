Hyping myself up for doing something, whether it be - playing a game (watching tips and tricks video, reviews, etc)
- configuring my arch setup (learning about plugins or watching someone set their's up)
- game dev (godot tutorial for a particular feature)

It's hyping myself up to do something. 

Some similar ideas 
- writing down why I want to do it in the first place
- what's so cool about it
- what's the dream here
- preparing for what's next

Can start off broad when starting a project, but will need to get specific if this is a day to day thing.

The main purpose is to induce motivation. It's to get that theorycrafting going so that when I get on that keyboard, I'm gonna start testing my theories rather than drag myself through doing it.
