# Levels of Quantum Computing 
> What are the levels here? What are my steps to mastery over this field? Let's say level 1 is going through the IBM Quantum learning portal (or some other course if you think it's better). Assume I'm completely unfamiliar with quantum computing. What is the goal in each level, what is the boss fight in each level, and what does mastery even look like?

Below is a deliberately game-tiered roadmap.  Each level has (1) a Skill Gate—what you must reliably do before moving on, (2) a Boss Fight—a single, non-trivial challenge that forces integrated competence, and (3) Failure Modes—places you’re likely to stumble given the meta-patterns you’ve shared (perfection looping, etc.).  Dates assume ~8 hrs/week; accelerate or stretch as needed.

Lv	Skill Gate (Goal)	Boss Fight (One-sitting challenge)	Typical Time	Failure Modes to watch

1. Foundations<br>(IBM Quantum Learning “Basics of Quantum Information” & “Quantum Circuits”) 	Explain qubit, superposition, measurement, entanglement, H and CNOT—in your own words, sans jargon crutch.  Type small circuits in Qiskit and read state-vectors without looking at the Bloch sphere.	Bell State Perfect Run: Build a 2-qubit Bell circuit, simulate 1 000 shots, and get ≥ 49 %	00⟩ & ≥ 49 %	11⟩ (ideal is 50 %).  Submit a ½-page “what just happened” debrief.
2. Hardware Rookie (NISQ intro)	Run the same Bell circuit on a free IBM backend (e.g., 5-qubit Falcon).  Pull calibration data, read T₁/T₂, and predict fidelity before the run.	CHSH Violation IRL: Achieve a CHSH score > 2.0 (classical limit) on real hardware; show your mitigation steps if noise drags it down.	2-4 weeks	• Cognitive-load bottleneck: drowning in SDK docs.  Keep API cheatsheet; resist installing multiple frameworks.
3. Algorithm Explorer	Implement and explain three “textbook” algorithms on a simulator: Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Grover (n = 4).  Write a one-paragraph intuition for each.	Grover on Hardware: Run the 4-qubit Grover search on cloud hardware, apply error mitigation, and beat the “lucky guess” baseline (≥ 35 % success vs. 6.25 %).	1-2 months	• High friction to delegation: doing manual transpilation when Tket / Qiskit transpiler can.  Let tools help—you’re here to learn concepts.
4. Variational Warrior	Build a simple VQE or QAOA loop with PennyLane or Qiskit runtime.  Understand cost landscapes and gradient noise.	H₂ Chemical Accuracy: Reach ≤ 1.6 mHa error on the ground-state energy of H₂ using < 300 circuit runs on a noisy backend.	2-3 months	• Trust calibration: blaming the optimizer when the ansatz is the culprit.  Instrument before you tweak hyper-params.
5. Error-Correction Adept	Simulate a distance-3 surface code logical qubit; track logical error vs. physical error rates.	Logical Survival: Demonstrate that your logical qubit lifetime exceeds any single physical qubit’s T₁ by ≥ 5× in simulation.  Explain the decoder.	3-4 months	• Perfection loop redux: trying distance-5+ before nailing distance-3.<br>• Ambiguity panic: surface-code papers assume group-theory comfort—ask targeted questions instead of silently spinning.
6. Contributor / Mastery	Publish an open-source PR (code or docs) or a short arXiv note proposing an improvement (algorithm, transpilation, or benchmarking).  Mentor another beginner through Lv 1.	Peer Review Boss: Defend your work in a public forum (GitHub review, workshop Q&A, or conference poster).  Survive critique and iterate.	open-ended	• Visibility anxiety: delaying release “until perfect.”  Remember: mastery requires shipping under feedback.


What “Mastery” looks like—pragmatically

You can translate a research abstract into an implementable circuit in < 1 day.

Hardware limits (connectivity, calibration drift) feel like engineering details, not show-stoppers—you instinctively budget depth & error.

You contribute net-new ideas or tools that other practitioners adopt (citations, GitHub stars, or production usage).

Your intuition for quantum speedups is falsifiable: you predict scaling and can defend why a proposal won’t beat classical heuristics.

Closing pushback

If you stall for a week because “Level 2 feels noisy and I don’t trust the data,” that’s perfection looping.  Ship the noisy Bell run, write what confuses you, and iterate.  Quantum—like Dark Souls—is learned in the boss arena, not on the loading screen.

Stay aggressive, keep the iterations small, and embrace the deaths.  See you at the CHSH boss fight.
