01 The Kybalion
[[Three Initiates]]

“The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding.”

*****

If you are a true student, you will be able to work out and apply these Principles—if not, then you must develop yourself into one, for otherwise the Hermetic Teachings will be as “words, words, words” to you.

*****

“casting pearls before swine,”

*****

“milk for babes; meat for strong men,”

*****

The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy is based, are as follows:
I. THE PRINCIPLE OF MENTALISM.
II. THE PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE.
III. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION.
IV. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY.
V. THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM.
VI. THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT.
VII. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER.

*****

An understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement.
--
The trust me bro principle 

*****

Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown.
--
Lots of words that say nothing. The book has been very masterbatory so far. Talking about what learning it will allow you to do instead of explaining what it even is. 

"It will let you do magic bro" is what I get from this 

*****

From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration—the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale.
--
String theory i guess? 

*****

An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others.
--
Another, "you will be able to do magic bro" 

*****

“Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree”;
--
Two sides to every coin

*****

it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to the vibrations of Love, in one’s own mind, and in the minds of others.
--
I've had a similar thought with politics and switching the arguments around but keeping the vocabulary the same. 

*****

a tide-like ebb and flow
--
Two poles, back and forth, creating vibration, at every scale, in an abstract way

*****

All individuals who have attained any degree of Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously, but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like a pendulum.
--
This is more social and behavioral principles than physical ones

*****

by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers instead of Effects.

*****

This is true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes. On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX, on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever the same.

*****

They possessed the Inner Knowledge as well as the Outer Knowledge,
--
Inner Knowledge is more yogic way of psychology and Outer Knowledge is more scientific way of psychology 

*****

Mental Transmutation is the “Art of Mental Chemistry

*****

“Magic”
--
Called it

*****

Substance” means: “that which underlies all outward manifestations; the essence; the essential reality; the thing in itself,” etc. “Substantial” means: “actually existing; being the essential element; being real,” etc. “Reality” means: “the state of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed; permanent; actual,” etc
--
Such a fuckin word salad. Defining 3 words that mean the same thing being described by more words that mean the same thing 

*****

nothing is permanent but Change.

*****

Men have given to this Substantial Reality many names—some have called it by the term of Deity (under many titles); others have called it “The Infinite and Eternal Energy”; others have tried to call it “Matter”
--
Trying to associate these ideas with real scientific concepts is what bothers me about the book. It's the same as a Hindu saint saying science/quantum mechanics has proven this religious thing or that religious thing while not understanding what the science actually said. 

Here, they say substantial Reality is supposed to be the undercurrent of the universe. But also relates it to Matter, which is the universe itself. But THE ALL is the universe, but it's some magical thing that controls the universe. This word salad is what makes this book so bad. 
Wherever they use these scientific words is confusing as to if they're talking about the word in its real context or their made up context. If it's the latter, this is will get worse

*****

their theories regarding its affairs, will, desires, plans, and designs;
--
Why do they use like 5 words for no reason. Just pick one word that you're trying to say. It just muddies the meaning instead of specifying it

Maybe not this sentence is guilty of that, but its what reminded me of the problem

*****

“THE ALL” is Infinite Living Mind—the Illumined call it SPIRIT!

*****

THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL CREATION OF THE ALL. Verily, indeed, ALL IS MIND!
--
Cute creation myth. But is it needed? 

*****

And even in our own little solar system there are regions and planes of life far higher than ours, and beings compared to which we earth-bound mortals are as the slimy life-forms that dwell on the ocean’s bed when compared to Man. There are beings with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever dreamed of the gods’ possessing. And yet these beings were once as you, and still lower—and you will be even as they, and still higher, in time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined.

*****

Remember the Divine Paradox, that while the Universe IS NOT, still IT IS. Remember ever the Two Poles of Truth—the Absolute and the Relative. Beware of Half-Truths.

*****

Absolute Truth has been defined as “Things as the mind of God knows them,” while Relative Truth is “Things as the highest reason of Man understands them.”

*****

“Transmutation, not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the Master.”
--
I want to believe all this, but this book is so poorly written 

*****

let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear, Richard III, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of their conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed within each of these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and action.

*****

in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling Spirit immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale of life. This is what spiritual development means—the recognition, realization, and manifestation of the Spirit within us.

*****

Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any “Reason” whatsoever for THE ALL to act, for a “reason” implies a “cause,” and THE ALL is above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which time the Principle is set into motion.

*****

I. The Great Physical Plane.
II. The Great Mental Plane.
III. The Great Spiritual Plane.

*****

These Seven Minor Physical Planes are as follows:
I. The Plane of Matter (A).
II. The Plane of Matter (B).
III. The Plane of Matter (C).
IV. The Plane of Ethereal Substance.
V. The Plane of Energy (A).
VI. The Plane of Energy (B).
VII. The Plane of Energy (C).

*****

The Plane of Matter (A) comprises the forms of Matter in its form of solids, liquids, and gases,

*****

The Plane of Matter (B) comprises certain higher and more subtle forms of Matter

*****

phenomena of Radiant Matter

*****

The Plane of Matter (C) comprises forms of the most subtle and tenuous Matter

*****

The Plane of Ethereal Substance comprises that which science speaks of as “The Ether,” a substance of extreme tenuity and elasticity, pervading all Universal Space, and acting as a medium for the transmission of waves of energy,

*****

Plane of Energy (A), which comprises the ordinary forms of Energy known to science, its seven sub-planes being, respectively, Heat; Light; Magnetism; Electricity, and Attraction (including Gravitation, Cohesion, Chemical Affinity, etc.)

*****

The Plane of Energy (B) comprises seven sub-planes of higher forms of energy not as yet discovered by science, but which have been called “Nature’s Finer Forces”

*****

The Plane of Energy (C) comprises seven sub-planes of energy so highly organized that it bears many of the characteristics of “life,” but which is not recognized by the minds of men on the ordinary plane of development, being available for the use on beingsof the Spiritual Plane alone—such energy is unthinkable to ordinary man, and may be considered almost as “the divine power.” The beings employing the same are as “gods” compared even to the highest human types known to us.

*****

I. The Plane of Mineral Mind.
II. The Plane of Elemental Mind (A).
III. The Plane of Plant Mind.
IV. The Plane of Elemental Mind (B).
V. The Plane of Animal Mind.
VI. The Plane of Elemental Mind (C).
VII. The Plane of Human Mind.

*****

The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their “loves and hates”; likes and dislikes; “attractions and repulsions”; “affinities and non-affinities,” etc., and some of the more daring of modern scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the desire and will, emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of men.

*****

The Plane of Elemental Mind (A) comprises the state or condition, and degree of mental and vital development of a class of entities unknown to the average man, but recognized to occultists. They are invisible to the ordinary senses of man, but, nevertheless, exist and play their part of the Drama of the Universe. Their degree of intelligence is between that of the mineral and chemical entities on the one hand, and of the entitiesof the plant kingdom on the other.

*****

The Plane of Plant Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states or conditions of the entities comprising the kingdoms of the Plant World,

*****

The Plane of Elemental Mind (B), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states and conditions of a higher form of “elemental” or unseen entities, playing their part in the general work of the Universe, the mind and life of which form a part of the scale between the Plane of Plant Mind and the Plane of Animal Mind, the entities partaking of the nature of both.

*****

The Plane of Animal Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states and conditions of the entities, beings, or souls, animating the animal forms of life, familiar to us all.

*****

The Plane of Elemental Mind (C), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises those entities or beings, invisible as are all such elemental forms, which partake of the nature of both animal and human life in a degree and in certain combinations. The highest forms are semi-human in intelligence.

*****

the average man of to-day occupies but the fourth sub-division of the Plane of Human Mind, and only the most intelligent have crossed the borders of the Fifth Sub-Division.

*****

The man of the Sixth Sub-Division will be “The Super-Man”; he of the Seventh will be “The Over-Man.”

*****

They are also necessary as “connecting links” of soul-condition; entity states, etc., between the several other planes, certain forms of development being attained therein—this last fact giving to the reader who can “read between the lines” a new light upon the processes of Evolution, and a new key to the secret door of the “leaps of life” between kingdom and kingdom.
--
"read between the lines"? I can barely read the line. Terrible writing 

*****

They teach that all manifestation of thought, emotion, reason, will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect the minds of other persons by “induction.” This is the principle which produces the phenomena of “telepathy”; mental influence, and other forms of the action and power of mind over mind

*****

Every thought, emotion or mental state has its corresponding rate and mode of vibration. And by an effort of the will of the person, or of other persons, these mental states may be reproduced,

*****

As one of the old Hermetic writers has truly said: “He who understands the Princible of Vibration, has grasped the sceptre of Power.”

*****

the Slothful man may change himself into an Active, Energetic individual, simply by polarizing along the lines of the desired quality.

*****

The pig suffers but little mentally, and enjoys but little—he is compensated.

*****

They teach that before one is able to enjoy a certain degree of pleasure, he must have swung as far, proportionately, toward the other pole of feeling. They hold, however, that the Negative is precedent to the Positive in this matter, that is to say that in experiencing a certain degree of pleasure it does not follow that he will have to “pay up for it” with a corresponding degree of pain; on the contrary, the pleasure is the Rhythmic swing, according to the Law of Compensation, for a degree of pain previously experienced either in the present life, or in a previous incarnation.

*****

“there is no great; there is no small; in the mind that causeth all.”

*****

“The further the creation is from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches, the nearer Free is it.”

*****

The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity,environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc.

*****

The Hermetic Teachings are that Man may use Law to overcome laws, and that the higher will always prevail against the lower, until at last he has reached the stage in which he seeks refuge in the LAW itself, and laughs the phenomenal laws to scorn.

*****

The “Me” will be felt to be a Something mental in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and other mental states may be produced. It may be considered as the “mental womb,” as the ancients styled it—capable of generating mental offspring.

*****

The tendency of the Feminine Principle is always in the direction of receiving impressions, while the tendency of the Masculine Principle is always in the direction of giving out, or expressing.

*****

The Masculine Principle contents itself with the work of the “Will,” in its varied phases. And yet without the active aid of the Will of the Masculine Principle, the Feminine Principle is apt to rest content with generating mental images which are the result of impressions received from outside, instead of producing original mental creations.

*****

The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a manifestation and expression in Action, is like the hoarding of precious metals—a vain and foolish thing. Knowledge, like Wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by reason of his conflict with natural forces.”—The Kybalion
--
Putting knowledge into practice is important 

*****

“To change your mood or mental state—change your vibration.”—The Kybalion.

*****

“To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration, put into operation the Principle of Polarity and concentrate upon the opposite pole to that which you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by changing its polarity.”—The Kybalion.
--
Build courage and fear will fade. Talk to people and shyness will fade. 

*****

“Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration.”—The Kybalion.
--
What is the difference between state, degree, condition, pole and vibration? 

*****

“Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the Art of Polarization.”—The Kybalion.
--
This is done by going meta (higher consciousness) and countering the issue from that meta perspective. Keeping the counter swing in mind. 

*****

“Nothing escapes the Principle of Cause and Effect, but there are many Planes of Causation, and one may use the laws of the higher to overcome the laws of the lower.”—The Kybalion.
--
By using the hermetic principles you can mitigate the causes and be the causer. This involves using the higher plane to control the lower plane. 

*****

“True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.”—The Kybalion.

Everything is mental i guess
