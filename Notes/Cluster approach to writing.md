Most research writing starts with picking a topic first and then researching and then writing. 
But a better way to do it would be to always keep following your interests and adding it to your knowledge base. This makes it trivial to find a topic since you just need to look to find a cluster in your notes. It will have arguments from different sources and following the lines of reasoning will lead to new arguments.
