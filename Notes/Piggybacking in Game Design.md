Complex mechanics are easier to design but harder to understand for the player. Piggybacking is a trick to make it easier to understand complex systems by turning them into metaphor a player already understands in a context that makes sense. It is a type of metaphor.

Example:
In _Plants vs Zombies,_ Plants were chosen because the defenders aren't supposed to move and using plants was a good way to convey that fact. Similarly Zombies were chose to represent the attackers because they were supposed to be slow and stupid. which is commonly associated with zombies.

Sometimes piggybacking can also influence game design if a metaphor doesn't fit perfectly.
