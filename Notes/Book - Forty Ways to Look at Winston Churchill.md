Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill
[[Gretchen Rubin]]

“This book does not seek to rival the works of professional historians. It aims rather to present a personal view.”

*****

“The Englishman will not, except on great occasions, be denied the indulgence of kicking out the Ministers of the Crown whoever they are.”

*****

Churchill also exploited the force of simile and metaphor. Of his opposition to socialism, he said, “We are for the ladder. Let all try their best to climb. They are for the queue.”

*****

When Churchill was running for office for the first time, he went door to door to ask for votes. He knocked on the door of an irritable man who, when Churchill introduced himself, said, “Vote for you? Why, I’d rather vote for the devil!”
“I understand,” answered Churchill. “But in case your friend is not running, may I count on your support?”

*****

“Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”

*****

Socialism seeks to pull down wealth, Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private interests—Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely by reconciling them with public right. Socialism would kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference

“Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.”

*****

“There is never a good time for a vacation, so take one anyway.”

In 1943, to an American critic of the Raj, Churchill said, “Before we proceed any further, let us get one thing clear. Are we talking about the brown Indians in India, who have multiplied alarmingly under the benevolent British rule? Or are we speaking of the red Indians in America who, I understand, are almost extinct?”

To the House of Commons on November 11, 1947, Churchill observed: “No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”

*****

Asked whether he was flattered by the crowds drawn by his speeches, Churchill replied, “It is quite flattering, but whenever I feel this way I always remember that, if instead of making a political speech, I was being hanged, the crowd would be twice as big.”

*****

Churchill recognized that the public needs to see its heroes clearly. “One of the most necessary features of a public man’s equipment,” Churchill noted, “is some distinctive mark which everyone learns to look for and to recognize.”

*****

“To be great,” Clementine reminded Churchill, “one’s actions must be understood by simple people.”

*****

He is not a man to rise to an hour. The hour has had to rise to him.

*****

He awoke about 8:00 A.M. and for hours worked and received visitors in bed.

*****

He and his exhausted aides finally went to bed sometime between 2:00 and 4:30 A.M. Once asleep, Churchill left strict orders that he wasn’t to be disturbed until 8:00 A.M., except in the case of actual invasion.

*****

Virtues and vices—like carpets and hats—obey the law of fashion, and at different times, society, with infuriating inconsistency, punishes or rewards the same trait.

*****

He wanted to improve the old order, not create a new one.

*****

In 1922, he wrote the Governor of Bengal’s wife:

I am sure . . . you will do your best to keep the Flag flying and the prestige and authority of the white man undiminished. Our true duty in India lies to those 300 millions whose lives and means of existence would be squandered if entrusted to the chatterboxes who are supposed to speak for India today.

*****

Hitler himself pointed this out: “But had this war not come, who would speak of Churchill?”

*****

“We have got all we want in territory, and our claim to be left in the unmolested enjoyment of vast and splendid possessions, mainly acquired by violence, largely maintained by force, often seems less reasonable to others than to us.”

*****

That is the tragic paradox: the hero gets what he wanted, but at a price he never imagined, and he could make no better choice.
