#game_notes 

Things i like:
- The voice acting is really good in this game
- I love the enemy chatter
- Quivksave quickload is a fun loop
- All the tiny interactions you can do
- the comics thing is good although been discussed to death
- the tone of the game is very mature. Discusses serious topics
- the atmosphere of the seedy hotel run by a gang is point on
- the writing is excellent
- bullet time pretty cool
- the face models are hilarious but somehow it works
- the tv shows are very well voice acted 
- didn't expect Parkour 

- omg the nightmare sequence
- that was extremely creative. Giving a twist to the start of our adventure. Even dropping a hint to Max's unrealibility as a narrator. The things this game does with such a limited pallet of gameplay options is extremely impressive. Technically all it was, was running down a corridor with the camera settings set to the extreme but it creates such a impactful moment. 

- the docks level where you're on the crane sniping goons. Very fun. 
- the last act of the game is very very fun. Especially once you get the assault rifle. 


Things I don't like
- the game is quite intense and playing in long stretches leaves me tired
- the boss fights was bit spongy. Understandable, but still. 

- Goddammit nightmare sequence 
- such an amazing moment ruined by asking you to tightrope walk in the middle of it. Took me right out of the game. Hell i had to switch to keyboard and mouse just to get through the section and i still had to quick save/load dozens of times. The worst part is that the nightmare sequence restarts from the beginning, so you have to walk the corridors all over again and since there's no actual solution to the maze (at least i think there isn't) it just got annoying. I had to do the whole section multiple times. First when the orginal blood line section caught me by surprise and killed me, then the second time i slipped because I didn't realise how janky it was. Third time was my own fault for not quicksaving. Fuuuuuck it ruined the moment. By the end of that part i was fully ignoring the crying baby. Such a disappointment. 

- the need to rely of quicksaves
-
