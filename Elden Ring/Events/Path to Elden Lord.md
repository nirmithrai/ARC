After the [[Return of the Tarnished]] they were tasked to stand before the [[Elden Ring]] and to become the [[Elden Lord]]

A message in a chamber the [[Chapel of Anticipation]] says that this path is broken and uncertain

Upon exiting the chamber, the [[Player Character]] is attacked and defeated by a creature known as [[Grafted Scion]]. Then ends up in the [[Folkhero's Grave]]

Here before they wake up, [[Melina]] and [[Torrent]] show up. She says how a [[Tarnished]] will seek the [[Elden Ring]] even if it violates the [[Golden Order]]

After fighting some undead and a couple of [[Godrick's Soldiers]] in the [[Folkhero's Grave]], the tarnished meets [[Varre]]. Who points us to [[Castle Stormveil]] and it's current occupant [[Godrick]]

Exploring the area you can find the [[Church of Elleh]], where [[Merchant Kale]] has set up his shop. 

Near the [[Gatefront Ruins]] the tarnished is greeted by [[Melina]], who gives us a [[Spectral Steed]]
