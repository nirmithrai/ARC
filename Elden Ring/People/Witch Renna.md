### Qs 
- Why did [[Torrent's Former Master]] give the [[Spirit Calling Bell]] to [[Witch Renna]], but [[Torrent]] itself ended up with [[Melina]]
- What do the [[Two Fingers]] have to do with the [[Tarnished]]? [[Witch Renna]] implies [[Tarnished]] obey the [[Two Fingers]] but suggests they will grow tired of it.
