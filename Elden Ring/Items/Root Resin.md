>The roots of the [[Greattree]] were once linked to those of the [[Erdtree]], or so they say, it is for this reason [[Catacombs]] are built around [[Greattree]] roots_

- [[Greattree]] and [[Erdtree]] are 2 different trees
- their roots were once linked it is said

### Qs
- Are the roots of [[Greattree]] and [[Erdtree]] not linked anymore? Why/not? Were they ever linked, or was it just a saying?
- What does their linkage have to do with [[Catacombs]]?
