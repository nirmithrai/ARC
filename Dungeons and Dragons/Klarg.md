### Orders
The chief of the [[Cragmaw Tribe]], [[King Grol]]  has ordered Klarg to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. 
A few days ago, a messenger from [[Cragmaw Castle]] brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and anyone traveling with him.
