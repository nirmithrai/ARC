Klarg the [[Bugbear]] Leader of the goblins in [[Cragmaw Hideout]]
He shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf, **Ripper**, and 2 goblins. 
### Behavior
The bugbear is filled with **delusions of grandeur** and views himself as a mighty
warlord just beginning his career of conquest. 
He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the **third person**
(“*Who dares defy Klarg?*” or “*Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!*”). 
The goblins under his command resent his bullying.

### Orders
The chief of the [[Cragmaw Tribe]], [[King Grol]]  has ordered Klarg to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. 
A few days ago, a messenger from [[Cragmaw Castle]] brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and anyone traveling with him.
