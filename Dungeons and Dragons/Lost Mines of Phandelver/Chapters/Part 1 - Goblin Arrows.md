# Start
> In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren
Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to
the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of
days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited
and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip,
saying only that he and his brothers had found “something
big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting
his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in
Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with
a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed
to arrive early to “take care of business.”
You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road
south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east
along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far,
but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have
been known to lurk along the trail

The [[PCs]] start in [[Neverwinter]] where they meet [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter]]. They are tasked with escorting a supply wagon to [[Stonehill Inn]] in [[Phandalin]].
