# Start
> In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren
Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to
the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of
days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited
and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip,
saying only that he and his brothers had found “something
big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting
his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in
Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with
a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed
to arrive early to “take care of business.”
You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road
south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east
along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far,
but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have
been known to lurk along the trail

The [[PCs]] start in [[Neverwinter]] where they meet [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter]]. They are tasked with escorting a supply wagon to [[Barthen’s Provisions]] in [[Phandalin]].

[[PCs]] take the [[High Road]] till they reach [[Triboar Trail]] 

# Goblin Ambush
> You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you
come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
dense thickets on either side.

After about half a day on [[Triboar Trail]] they find 2 dead horses blocking the road.
On investigation they realize these horses belong to [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter]]

> The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty
leather map case.

4 [[Goblins]] are hiding nearby. 2 Melee and 2 Ranged. If 3 die, last one will try to run away.

### Developments
- If goblins win, they leave the [[PCs]] unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the [[Cragmaw Hideout]].
- If the players can capture a goblin, the goblin will share [[What the Goblins Know]], can be persuaded to lead the party to [[Cragmaw Hideout]] while avoiding traps along the way.
- If they kill all the goblins, they can investigate the area to find the [[#Goblin Trail]]
- If they don't find the [[#Goblin Trail]] they can continue to [[Phandalin]] and the owner of [[Barthen’s Provisions]] will tell them to go back and find [[Gundren Rockseeker]]
