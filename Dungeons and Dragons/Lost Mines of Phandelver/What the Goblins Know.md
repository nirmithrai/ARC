If the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:
- Fewer than **twenty goblins** currently dwell in the lair.
- Their leader is a bugbear named **[[Klarg]]**. He answers to **[[King Grol]]**, chief of the [[Cragmaw Tribe]], who dwells in [[Cragmaw Castle]]. 
- The goblins can provide **basic directions to [[Cragmaw Castle]]**. ![[Cragmaw Castle#Location]]
- [[Klarg]] received a **messenger goblin from [[King Grol]]** a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the **[[Black Spider]]** was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the **dwarf [[Gundren Rockseeker]], capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to [[King Grol]]**. [[Klarg]] followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.
- **The dwarf and his map were delivered to [[King Grol]]**, as instructed. The dwarfâ€™s human companion ([[Sildar Hallwinter]]) is being held in the [[Cragmaw Hideout#6 Goblin Den]]
