# Goblin Ambush
> You've been on the [[Triboar Trail]] for about half a day. As you
come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
dense thickets on either side.

After about half a day on [[Triboar Trail]] they find 2 dead horses blocking the road.
On investigation they realize these horses belong to [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter]]

> The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty
leather map case.

4 [[Goblins]] are hiding nearby. 2 Melee and 2 Ranged. If 3 die, last one will try to run away.

### Developments
- If goblins win, they leave the [[PCs]] unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the [[Cragmaw Hideout]].
- If the players can capture a goblin, the goblin will share [[What the Goblins Know]], can be persuaded to lead the party to [[Cragmaw Hideout]] while avoiding traps along the way.
- If they kill all the goblins, they can investigate the area to find the [[#Goblin Trail]]
- If they don't find the [[#Goblin Trail]] they can continue to [[Phandalin]] and the owner of [[Stonehill Inn]] will tell them to go back and find [[Gundren Rockseeker]]
