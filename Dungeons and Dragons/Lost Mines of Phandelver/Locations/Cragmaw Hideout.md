# People
![[Cragmaw Tribe]]

## Leader
A [[Bugbear]] called [[Klarg]] resides in [[#8 Klarg's Cave]]
![[Klarg#Orders]]

## Creatures
A number of [[Goblins]] guard the cave.

## NPCs
[[Sildar Hallwinter]] is being held captive. 
[[Gundren Rockseeker]] has been moved to [[Cragmaw Castle]] from here.

# General Features
- **Ceilings**: Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.
- **Light**: [[#1 Cave Mouth]] & [[#2 Goblin Blind]] are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.
- **Rubble**: Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the rulebook).
- **Sound**: The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren’t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.
- **Stalagmites**: These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see “Cover” in the rulebook).
- **Stream**: The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.
 
# Map
 ![[Cragmaw Hideout Map.png]]
# 1. Cave Mouth
 > Following the goblins’ trail, you come across a large cave in
a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow
stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by
dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on
the right-hand side of the stream.

### Developments
- 2 goblins in [[#2 Goblin Blind]] are supposed to watch this area but are very lazy.
- They will be alert if they are expecting attackers
- Will attack [[PCs]] if they are too loud
# 2. Goblin Blind
> On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a
small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form
a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars
and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the
area— including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!

- 2 goblins here, both with bow and arrows
- **Thickets** around the clearing are *difficult terrain* and provide *half cover* when attacking through them

# 3. Kennel
> Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead
up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage.
The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled
with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of
rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained
up just inside the opening. Each wolf’s chain leads to an iron
rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.

- 3 wolves are tied up here.
- Other goblins ignore their sounds
- 15 Animal Handling to calm them. 10 if given food

### Fissure
Narrow opening on the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 ft to [[#8 Klarg's Cave]]. 10 Athletics to climb up/down. Move at half speed if success. No up or down for 6-9. < 5 fall down and take fall damage land prone.

### Developments
Wolves can get out of their chains.
- Immediately if goaded
- every round wolves attempt strength check. DC 15 first try, 10 after 1 success, then its free
- Goblin or Bugbear can set them free

# 4. Steep Passage
**Dark**
> The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply
upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west
side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the
other side of the stream.

- Dim vision can see the [[#5 Overpass]]. To find the goblin on it, Perception vs Stealth
>In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make
out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope
crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage
intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.
- Goblin on the [[#5 Overpass]] will see them if they have light or aren't in stealth. If it sees them, it sneaks to [[#7 Twin Pools Cave]] to release the [[#Flood]].

### Western Passage
There is a small tunnel through which players can crawl through to the [[#6 Goblin Den]]. Dex check to see if they get stuck

# 5. Overpass
> The stream passage continues up beyond another set of
uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall
sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.

- **Bridge**(5 AC, 10HP): 20 ft above the stream. Can be climbed on to from the walls (15 Athletics).

## Flood
- Large pools in [[#7 Twin Pools Cave]] can be released to flood water down the main passage. 
- 1 round after the [[#5 Overpass]] goblin signals the water is released up to [[#1 Cave Mouth]].
> The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge
surge of rushing water pours down from above!
- People on bridge and on the wall are safe.
- Anyone within 10 ft of the  [[#Western Passage]] or [[#3 Kennel]] makes 10 Dex save.
- Anyone in the main passage has to make 15 STR save.
- Anyone swept away is knocked prone and washed down to [[#1 Cave Mouth]], takes 1d6 bldg dmg.
- Goblins get ready for 2nd pool. 
# 6. Goblin Den
> This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high
escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower
portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of
a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured
hides and unwashed goblins.

- 5 goblins + 1 Leader with 12Hp
- Leader on the upper area, everyone else on lower area
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] (1HP) is a prisoner in the upper area. Securely bound. 
- Leader [[Yeemik]], wants to parlay. Drags prisoner over the edge and says, "Truce or he dies"
- Asks players to kill [[Klarg]] in exchange for prisoner
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] warns not to trust him
- If deal is taken and completed, will ask for a ransom to release the prisoner
- If deal not taken, he pushes the prisoner over the edge. Prisoner is now dying.
- If [[Sildar Hallwinter]] is saved. He asks players to escort him to [[Phandalin]] with a promise of 50gp as reward.
- Hopes you clear the cave of goblins

### Treasure
[[Yeemik]] carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp.
# 7. Twin Pools Cave
> This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A
narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which
drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream
that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls
serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the
south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of
the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear

- 3 goblins guard the room
- if warned, they are on alert
- sound of fighting drowned out by the waterfall
- when fight breaks out 1 goblin runs to [[#8 Klarg's Cave]] to warn [[Klarg]]

**Rock Dams**
Simple dam of fieldstone. If [[#Flood]] has triggered these are mostly empty.
# 8. Klarg's Cave
> Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the
south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes
toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A
larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps,
the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle
of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.

- Lots of stolen goods here.
- [[Klarg]] with his pet Wolf, **Ripper**, and 2 goblins are in the cave.

**Fire Pit**
- 1 fire dmg if stepping on the pit
- 1d6 if prone on it

**Natural Chimney**
- shaft that descends to [[#3 Kennel]]. [[#Fissure]]

**Supplies** 
- these provide *half cover* 
- Most are marked with image of a **Blue Lion**, a symbol of the [[Lionshield Coster]]

### Developments
- If [[Klarg]] is warned, everyone is alert, they hide to try to ambush.
- If not, they can be surprised esp from [[#Fissure]]
- if wolf is killed, [[Klarg]] attempts to run away through the [[#Fissure]]

### Treasure
- Bulky stores, which needs the wagon to transport. 50gp for returning them to [[Lionshield Coster]] and their friendship
- Treasure Chest
	- 600cp
	- 110sp
	- 2x Potions of healing
	- small Jade Statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40gp)
