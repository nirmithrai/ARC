# Basics
- A large decrepit manor at the top of a hill in [[Phandalin]]
- secretly the base for the [[Redbrands]] and where [[GlassStaff]] currently hides.
- the roof has collapsed and an inspection of the stone can reveal that the walls could be caved in if hit hard enough
- Will be taken over by the [[Thunder Tree Dragon]] during [[The Scouring of Phandalin]]

# People
# General Features
> The hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with
flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The
western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end,
with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

- **Ceilings**. Passages and chambers are **10 feet high** unless otherwise indicated.
- **Doors**. All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are **unlocked** unless the text states otherwise. [[Iarno Albrek]] ([[#12 GlassStaff's Quarters]]) and a bugbear named [[Mosk]] ([[#9 Guard Barracks]]) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex. 
  A **locked door** can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.
- **Secret Doors**. An “S” on the Redbrand Hideout map
indicates the location of a secret door. Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on
hidden iron hinges and are not locked. 
- **Light**. Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.

# 1. Cellar
> The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet
above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor
in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to
the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of
the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.

- It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor
- Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.

chamber.

>Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The
walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and
the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed
in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a
mournful angel graces the doors.

- The pit trap in the middle of the hallway is hidden under a false floor consisting of loose stone tiles laid atop breakaway timbers.
- A character searching the hall for traps can spot the covered pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (**Perception**) check.
-  A successful check also reveals narrow ledges on the north and south sides of
the pit. A creature attempting to skirt around the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (**Acrobatics**) check.
- A creature that triggers the trap or **fails** the Dexterity check to skirt around the edge of the pit must attempt a DC 15 **Dexterity saving throw** to catch the edge.
- On a **failed save**, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the
pit, taking **2d6 bludgeoning damage** and landing **prone**.

and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human
skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail. False columns along
the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees.

tarnished copper plate.
