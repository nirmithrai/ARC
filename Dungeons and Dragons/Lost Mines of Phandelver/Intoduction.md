# Background
>More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and
gnomes made an agreement known as the [[Phandelver’s Pact]], 
by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous
cavern known as [[Wave Echo Cave]]. In addition to its
mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.
Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves
and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great
forge (called the [[Forge of Spells]]), where magic items could
be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town
of [[Phandalin]] (pronounced *fan*-duh-lin) prospered as well.
But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the
North and laid waste to all in their path.

> A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary
wizards attacked [[Wave Echo Cave]] to seize its riches and
magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their
dwarf and gnome allies to defend the [[Forge of Spells]], and
the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern.
Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of
[[Wave Echo Cave]] was lost.

> For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted
treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around
Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the
lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area.
Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More
important, the [[Rockseeker Brothers | Rockseekers]]—a trio of dwarves -
have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they
intend to reopen the mines.

> Unfortunately for the [[Rockseeker Brothers]], they are not the only
ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain
known as the [[Black Spider]] controls a network of bandit
gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have
followed the [[Rockseeker Brothers]] to their prize. Now the Black
Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is
taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.
