# General Features
- **Ceilings**: Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.
- **Light**: [[#1 Cave Mouth]] & [[#2 Goblin Blind]] are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.
- **Rubble**: Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the rulebook).
- **Sound**: The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren’t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.
- **Stalagmites**: These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see “Cover” in the rulebook).
- **Stream**: The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.
 
# Map

# 1. Cave Mouth
 > Following the goblins’ trail, you come across a large cave in
a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow
stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by
dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on
the right-hand side of the stream.

### Developments
- 2 goblins in [[#2 Goblin Blind]] are supposed to watch this area but are very lazy.
- They will be alert if they are expecting attackers
- Will attack [[PCs]] if they are too loud
# 2. Goblin Blind
> On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a
small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form
a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars
and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the
area— including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!

- 2 goblins here, both with bow and arrows
- **Thickets** around the clearing are *difficult terrain* and provide *half cover* when attacking through them

# 3. Kennel
> Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead
up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage.
The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled
with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of
rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained
up just inside the opening. Each wolf’s chain leads to an iron
rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.

- 3 wolves are tied up here.
- Other goblins ignore their sounds
- 15 Animal Handling to calm them. 10 if given food
