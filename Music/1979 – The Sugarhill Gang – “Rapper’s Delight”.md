I can't believe how good the music on this is. How is the production better than half of modern Hip Hop? I also recognize a lot of the music on this. Really makes me want to explore r&b and soul music. 

It's a bit too long but i did listen to the long version. I think it's the lack of meat on the lyrics that makes it feel too long. Like it feels like just filler bars. I'll chalk it up to the seinfeld effect. 

Dissing MC's on the first Hip Hop track is kinda iconic ngl.
