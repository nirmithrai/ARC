Reminds me of Vice City soundtrack. 

Appropriately, there seems to be more of a message in this one. It's a good message. Story telling is upgraded. 

Production is still funky. 

This is a song that you could easily mistake as a simple groovy song if you didn't pay attention to what he was saying. Almost like he's trying to hide the message in an upbeat tone.
